According to initial police reports, the explosion took place close to two police vehicles near Gate 2 of Data Darbar. The nature and exact target of the explosion is yet to be ascertained. Rescue operations are underway. The blast comes as the country marks the fasting month of Ramzan.\n\nData Darbar, located in Pakistan\u2019s Lahore city, is one of the oldest Sufi shrines in South Asia. Considered to be one of the most sacred places in Lahore, the shrine houses the remains of Sufi saint Abul Hassan Ali Hujwiri, commonly known as Data Ganj Baksh. He is said to have lived on the site in the 11th century and was reputed to have miraculous powers.\n\nData Darbar attracts a lot of visitors to its annual Urs festival. The Urs marks the death anniversary of the Sufi saint.\n\nAccording to the BBC, the shrine was originally established as a simple grave next to the mosque which Hujwiri had built on the outskirts of Lahore in the 11th century. It was later expanded in the 13th century to commemorate the burial site of Hujwiri after his spiritual powers became popular.\n\nFor centuries, the shrine has seen visitors from all religions. Pakistan\u2019s former prime minister Nawaz Sharif is also a frequent visitor to the shrine.\n\nIn 2010, two suicide bombers detonated their explosive vests outside the shrine, killing close to 50 people.

Soon after the occurrence, the mob present at the shrine got infuriated and started pelting the police officials on duty with stones.\u201d\n\nOn December 18, 2007, militants had blown up the shrine of Abdul Shakoor Malang Baba on the Grand Trunk Road.\n\nIn March 2008, an attack on the 400-year-old shrine of Hazrat Abu Saeed Baba on the outskirts of Peshawar had killed 10 villagers.\n\nThe March 5, 2009 attack on the shrine of Rehman Baba, a revered Pashto Sufi poet of the 17th century, was widely condemned in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nAlthough the bombing of Rehman Baba\u2019s shrine near Peshawar did not result in any casualty, it had left an indelible mark on the sanctity of his shrine. A day after the attack on Rehman Baba\u2019s shrine, the shrine of Bahadur Baba was targeted by missiles.\n\nSince the Rehman Baba shrine attack, numerous Sufi shrines in Hangu, Nowshera and Buner were bombed, burnt or closed down. Simultaneously, attacks mosques claimed casualties running in hundreds.\n\nA suicide attack on the shrine of Sufi Saint, Abdullah Shah Ghazi, in Karachi had killed nine people in October 2010.\n\nAn attack on the 12th-century Sufi saint Baba Fariduddin Ganj Shakar\u2019s shrine in Pakpattan, also occurring in October 2010, had left seven people dead.\n\nOn April 3, 2011, some 52 people were killed and 120 wounded when two suicide bombers detonated explosives at the shrine of the 13th-century saint Ahmed Sultan, popularly known as Sakhi Sarwar, at Dera Ghazi Khan.\n\nOn March 1 this year, the Supreme Court had upheld a life imprisonment sentence awarded by a trial court to a would-be suicide bomber in the Sakhi Sarwar shrine suicide attack case.\n\nThe accused, Bahram alias Sufi Baba, was given the death penalty 52 times and awarded life imprisonment 73 times. He was accused of preparing the suicide bomb for the attack.\n\nThe Supreme Court, however, declared this sentence null and void as the prosecution did not provide sufficient evidence.\n\nThe second accused, Umar Fidai, had been sentenced to life imprisonment 125 times by a trial court. The appeal against his sentence was dismissed by the country's highest court.\n\nThe Chief Justice had asked how one could be sentenced for life 125 times in one lifetime. He ordered the running of all sentences simultaneously. The shrines of Sufi saints Sheikh Nisa Baba and Sheikh Bahadur Baba in Khyber Agency were attacked on December 11, 2012.\n\nOn February 25, 2013, the shrine of Ghulam Shah Ghazi, in Marri village near Shikarpur, was attacked, killing four people on the scene and wounding more than 27 others.\n\nAmong the dead was Pir Syed Hajan Shah \u2013 a spiritual leader. He had died on March 4. After the news of Shah\u2019s death spread; markets, businesses and trade centres across Sindh were closed down voluntarily on March 5 to honour him. It is imperative to note that just five days earlier on February 20, 2013, militants had attacked the convoy of another Sindhi spiritual leader, Syed Hussain Shah (popularly known as Saeen Hussain Shah Qambar), with a remote-controlled bomb in the Ahmed Deen Brohi area of Jacobabad District. He had escaped unharmed, but the bomb killed his grandson Shafiq Shafi Shah and injured eight others.\n\nOn November 12, 2016, over 50 devotees at the remote shrine of Shah Noorani in Khuzdar, Balochistan, were massacred. Several people were killed and injured due to a stampede caused by the blast and scores of injured were transported to hospital in private vehicles by visitors who survived the attack.\n\nIn October 2017, a suicide bomber had again targeted the shrine of Sufi saint, Pir Rakhel Shah, at Jhal Magsi in Balochistan after a gap of 12 years, killing around 20 people on the spot.\n\nOn February 17, 2017, a suicide bomber had struck the devotees at the gold-domed mausoleum of revered Sufi saint Syed Usman Marwandi, also known as the Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, at Sehwan Sharif in Sindh, resulting in at least 83 deaths within hours of the attack.\n\nA series of attacks over the last five days in February 2017 had hit all four of Pakistan\u2019s provinces and two major cities, killing nearly 100 people.\n\nThe \u201cReuters\u201d had reported: \u201cThe shrine is one of Pakistan\u2019s most revered holy sites and attracts up to a million visitors each year. It is perhaps best known for men and women practicing the ancient form of Sufi dance called the \u2018dhamaal\u2019.\u201d\n\nHazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar\u2019s shrine was built in 1356 and is decorated with Sindhi \u2018kashi-tiles\u2019 classic mirror-work and a fabulous gold-plated door donated by Iran\u2019s Emperor Reza Shah Pahlavi. This door was installed by the late Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.\n\nLal Shahbaz Qalandar (1177-1275), called Lal (red) for donning a red attire throughout his life, had not only preached peace and love throughout his stay on the planet along with his contemporaries like Bahauddin Zakariya, Baba Fariduddin Ganj Shakar and Syed Jalaluddin Bukhari but is also globally respected for being a symbol of pluralism, inter-faith harmony and collective aesthetics.", "url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/468766-attacks-on-shrines-of-revered-sufi-saints-continue", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": "2019-05-08 19:00:00+05:00"}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9999902257827731, "vector": [0.40683725050692127, 0.44727391700488855, 2.0, 3.0], "id": 70114}], "id": "8fed531d-21a8-4b47-9af8-86c7cf1f64fd", "title": "Bomb targeting Pakistani police at shrine kills 4 in Lahore", "text": "LAHORE, Pakistan \u2014 A powerful bomb exploded near security forces guarding a famous Sufi shrine in the eastern city of Lahore on Wednesday, killing at least four people and wounding 20 others, police said.\n\nCity police chief Ghazanfar Ali said police officers were the apparent target of bombing outside the shrine which is known as Data Darbar, and where a famous Sufi saint Ali Hajveri is buried.

Soon after the occurrence, the mob present at the shrine got infuriated and started pelting the police officials on duty with stones.\u201d\n\nOn December 18, 2007, militants had blown up the shrine of Abdul Shakoor Malang Baba on the Grand Trunk Road.\n\nIn March 2008, an attack on the 400-year-old shrine of Hazrat Abu Saeed Baba on the outskirts of Peshawar had killed 10 villagers.\n\nThe March 5, 2009 attack on the shrine of Rehman Baba, a revered Pashto Sufi poet of the 17th century, was widely condemned in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nAlthough the bombing of Rehman Baba\u2019s shrine near Peshawar did not result in any casualty, it had left an indelible mark on the sanctity of his shrine. A day after the attack on Rehman Baba\u2019s shrine, the shrine of Bahadur Baba was targeted by missiles.\n\nSince the Rehman Baba shrine attack, numerous Sufi shrines in Hangu, Nowshera and Buner were bombed, burnt or closed down. Simultaneously, attacks mosques claimed casualties running in hundreds.\n\nA suicide attack on the shrine of Sufi Saint, Abdullah Shah Ghazi, in Karachi had killed nine people in October 2010.\n\nAn attack on the 12th-century Sufi saint Baba Fariduddin Ganj Shakar\u2019s shrine in Pakpattan, also occurring in October 2010, had left seven people dead.\n\nOn April 3, 2011, some 52 people were killed and 120 wounded when two suicide bombers detonated explosives at the shrine of the 13th-century saint Ahmed Sultan, popularly known as Sakhi Sarwar, at Dera Ghazi Khan.\n\nOn March 1 this year, the Supreme Court had upheld a life imprisonment sentence awarded by a trial court to a would-be suicide bomber in the Sakhi Sarwar shrine suicide attack case.\n\nThe accused, Bahram alias Sufi Baba, was given the death penalty 52 times and awarded life imprisonment 73 times. He was accused of preparing the suicide bomb for the attack.\n\nThe Supreme Court, however, declared this sentence null and void as the prosecution did not provide sufficient evidence.\n\nThe second accused, Umar Fidai, had been sentenced to life imprisonment 125 times by a trial court. The appeal against his sentence was dismissed by the country's highest court.\n\nThe Chief Justice had asked how one could be sentenced for life 125 times in one lifetime. He ordered the running of all sentences simultaneously.\n\nThe shrines of Sufi saints Sheikh Nisa Baba and Sheikh Bahadur Baba in Khyber Agency were attacked on December 11, 2012.\n\nOn February 25, 2013, the shrine of Ghulam Shah Ghazi, in Marri village near Shikarpur, was attacked, killing four people on the scene and wounding more than 27 others.\n\nAmong the dead was Pir Syed Hajan Shah \u2013 a spiritual leader. He had died on March 4. After the news of Shah\u2019s death spread; markets, businesses and trade centres across Sindh were closed down voluntarily on March 5 to honour him.\n\nIt is imperative to note that just five days earlier on February 20, 2013, militants had attacked the convoy of another Sindhi spiritual leader, Syed Hussain Shah (popularly known as Saeen Hussain Shah Qambar), with a remote-controlled bomb in the Ahmed Deen Brohi area of Jacobabad District. He had escaped unharmed, but the bomb killed his grandson Shafiq Shafi Shah and injured eight others.\n\nOn November 12, 2016, over 50 devotees at the remote shrine of Shah Noorani in Khuzdar, Balochistan, were massacred. Several people were killed and injured due to a stampede caused by the blast and scores of injured were transported to hospital in private vehicles by visitors who survived the attack.\n\nIn October 2017, a suicide bomber had again targeted the shrine of Sufi saint, Pir Rakhel Shah, at Jhal Magsi in Balochistan after a gap of 12 years, killing around 20 people on the spot.\n\nOn February 17, 2017, a suicide bomber had struck the devotees at the gold-domed mausoleum of revered Sufi saint Syed Usman Marwandi, also known as the Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, at Sehwan Sharif in Sindh, resulting in at least 83 deaths within hours of the attack.\n\nA series of attacks over the last five days in February 2017 had hit all four of Pakistan\u2019s provinces and two major cities, killing nearly 100 people.\n\nThe \u201cReuters\u201d had reported: \u201cThe shrine is one of Pakistan\u2019s most revered holy sites and attracts up to a million visitors each year. It is perhaps best known for men and women practicing the ancient form of Sufi dance called the \u2018dhamaal\u2019.\u201d\n\nHazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar\u2019s shrine was built in 1356 and is decorated with Sindhi \u2018kashi-tiles\u2019 classic mirror-work and a fabulous gold-plated door donated by Iran\u2019s Emperor Reza Shah Pahlavi. This door was installed by the late Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.\n\nLal Shahbaz Qalandar (1177-1275), called Lal (red) for donning a red attire throughout his life, had not only preached peace and love throughout his stay on the planet along with his contemporaries like Bahauddin Zakariya, Baba Fariduddin Ganj Shakar and Syed Jalaluddin Bukhari but is also globally respected for being a symbol of pluralism, inter-faith harmony and collective aesthetics.", "url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/469047-attacks-on-shrines-of-revered-sufi-saints-continue", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": "2019-05-08 19:00:00+05:00"}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9999876531147253, "vector": [0.39068258399333855, 0.44344849661073843, 2.0, 3.0], "id": 70114}], "id": "e9ff5d1d-3fa5-4dc8-81a1-981c90bc3e1a", "title": "Bomb blast in Pakistan's Lahore , 4 killed ,several injured", "text": "Pakistani police say a powerful bomb has exploded near security forces guarding a famous Sufi shrine in the eastern city of Lahore, killing at least four people and wounding several others.\n\nCity police chief Ghazanfar Ali says police officers were the apparent target of Wednesday\u2019s bombing outside the shrine which is known as Data Darbar.

The injured were shifted to the Mayo Hospital, confirmed Rescue 1122 officials. Forensic experts collected evidence from the blast site and emergency was declared in hospitals of the provincial metropolis following the blast. The experts also collected the remains of the suicide bomber. The age of the bomber apparently ranged from eighteen to twenty, the police believed. He appeared from Sheesh Mahal Road on foot, approached the Elite Force personnel carrier and detonated his explosives near the vehicle. The police cordoned off the area soon after the attack and started investigations.\n\nThe martyred police officials are Head Constable Muhammad Suhail, Head Constable Shahid Nazir, Head Constable Gulzar Ali and Constable Muhammad Saleem The martyred citizens include private security guard Rafaqat, Rafique and four unknown persons including a 12-year-old child.

The Metro Bus Service was suspended from the MAO College to Data Darbar. Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar cancelled his trip to Bhakkar and summoned the officers of the Punjab Safe Cities Authority. He asked the IGP Punjab to submit a report on the incident.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan condemned the blast and sought a report. The premier condoled with the bereaved families and directed the authorities concerned to provide best possible medical treatment to those injured in the blast.\n\nThe IGP visited Data Darbar after the blast and condemned the terror attack. He also monitored rescue and relief activities. He said the suicide attack was a cowardly act of anti-social elements, which could not shake the commitment of brave officials to protect the lives and properties of the public. He directed all RPOs and DPOs to visit field during Taraveeh prayers to check the security of \u201cA\u201d category at mosques. He directed that on highways, a sniper should be deputed at a distance from check-posts to handle any untoward incident. He said that senior officers should brief officials on security duty about the sensitivity of their duty on a daily basis to get best results. He directed beefing up security at sensitive mosques, Imambargahs and business centres. Search, sweep, combing and intelligence-based operations should be geared up to improve security at entry and exit points of the city. He said the Punjab Police are acting as front line soldiers in the war against terrorism and sacrifices of police officials for peace in the country will not go waste. The DIG Operations also visited the crime scene and gave instructions to the officers with regard to strengthening the security across the city.\n\nCTD investigators have collected one hand of the suicide bomber and dispatched it to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency for identification. The CTD registered FIR No 11/19 under Sections 302/324186/353, 427/34120-B/109 of PPC, \u00be of Explosive Substance Act and 7 ATA. The complainant has said that three terrorists including the suicide bomber had approached the Elite Force vehicle from the Minar-e-Pakistan side. Two handlers left the place by shaking hands with the bomber and disappeared in the adjoining locality. The blast was so powerful that buildings were jolted while windowpanes shattered. The incident created panic in the locality.\n\nThe CCTV footage shows that the suicide bomber wearing Shalwar Kameez and waistcoat approached the Elite Force mobile and exploded himself with a big bang. It could be clearly seen in the footage that he was holding the trigger of the detonator in hand and was quickly moving forward towards the police personnel carrier. However, the officials of the Punjab Safe Cities Authority deputed for monitoring suspicious activities could not spot him that helped him achieve his target.\n\nIt is worth-mentioning here that the Hizb-ul-Ahrar, a faction of the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the attack in a message disseminated on the social media. The CTD and other law-enforcement agencies are trying to authenticate the claim. The spokesperson of the terrorist organization has termed the blast an Ishtihadi (suicidal) attack. It claimed targeting 12 personnel of law-enforcement agencies including cops and officials of sensitive agencies. The spokesman also claimed that there was no public at the time of the attack. In fact, a number of visitors fell victim to the blast and received injuries. The coward terrorist organization has threatened to carry further attacks on big targets.\n\nCCPO Lahore BA Nasir visited the Mayo Hospital twice to inquire after the injured and presented the injured policemen with bouquets and cash amount of Rs 50,000 each.\n\nThree persons from Multan were killed in the blast and all of them belonged to the same village, the police said. The residents of Basti Jhandeywali on the Multan-Vehari road, Muhammad Rafiq, his eight years old son Ahmed and cousin Mushtaq Ahmed had gone to Data Darbar for pilgrimage, said Punjab Energy Minister Dr Akhtar Malik.\n\nChief Minister Usman Buzdar has directed the authorities concerned to trace the network responsible for the blast at Data Darbar as soon as possible. He gave these directions while chairing a meeting at the Punjab Safe Cities Authority head office to review the law and order situation after the blast.\n\nThe inspector general of police, Punjab, presented the initial report regarding the incident to the CM. The CM was also apprised of the progress made in investigations. \u201cWe pay tributes to the sacrifices of martyrs and their heirs will not be left alone. We share the grief with them,\u201d he said.\n\nProvincial Ministers Basharat Raja, Hashim Dogar, Taimoor Khan and the chief secretary were present.\n\nSpecial Assistant to Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan condemned the blast.

The claims it had been ended were shattered on Wednesday morning in Lahore when a suicide bomber detonated his vest next to a vehicle carrying members of the Elite police force in the immediate proximity of the Data Darbar shrine in Lahore. The shrine is a major site of Sufi Islam in the country, visited by millions each year. Since 2010, when blasts inside the complex killed scores, there has been heavy security thrown around the mausoleum and it appears these security forces were targeted in the latest attack. At least ten people are reported to be killed, including three security personnel. We cannot say if the selection of the location for the bombing was intended to send out a message in itself. Orthodox religious forces, including those engaged in militancy, have traditionally opposed Sufi Islamic beliefs and there has been some squabbling between sects over this. According to some reports in the media, a Taliban splinter faction claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nWhat we do know in certainty is that more lives have been needlessly lost. After a considerable period of time, a major terrorist attack has taken place in the city of Lahore. This in itself suggests that militants are able to operate everywhere and anywhere they choose in the country, without hindrance. The omens are not good in this respect. It is obviously impossible for security personnel to control or cordon off every alley and every square in a major city, with the Data Darbar shrine located in a particularly congested and heavily used area. The focus then has to be to find the places from where these groups operate, to capture their leaders and to dismantle their organisations. Yes, significant groups who had carried out attacks in the past have been weakened. But it seems killers can still unleash mayhem in our midst.\n\nThe message that goes out to the world and to the citizens of Pakistan itself, just as the holy month of Ramazan begins, is not a positive one. It suggests we are still held hostage to militants who use religion for their own purposes. They have not spared a shrine which brings together tens of thousands of believers even during a month that is sacred to Muslims everywhere. This should alert us to the fact that the people who kill are not true believers. Their purposes are different and they are dangerous. They have already created chaos across the country and divided it increasingly along lines of sect, belief, ethnicity, and ideology.

The claims it had been ended were shattered on Wednesday morning in Lahore when a suicide bomber detonated his vest next to a vehicle carrying members of the Elite police force in the immediate proximity of the Data Darbar shrine in Lahore. The shrine is a major site of Sufi Islam in the country, visited by millions each year. Since 2010, when blasts inside the complex killed scores, there has been heavy security thrown around the mausoleum and it appears these security forces were targeted in the latest attack. At least ten people are reported to be killed, including three security personnel. We cannot say if the selection of the location for the bombing was intended to send out a message in itself. Orthodox religious forces, including those engaged in militancy, have traditionally opposed Sufi Islamic beliefs and there has been some squabbling between sects over this. According to some reports in the media, a Taliban splinter faction claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nWhat we do know in certainty is that more lives have been needlessly lost. After a considerable period of time, a major terrorist attack has taken place in the city of Lahore. This in itself suggests that militants are able to operate everywhere and anywhere they choose in the country, without hindrance. The omens are not good in this respect. It is obviously impossible for security personnel to control or cordon off every alley and every square in a major city, with the Data Darbar shrine located in a particularly congested and heavily used area. The focus then has to be to find the places from where these groups operate, to capture their leaders and to dismantle their organisations. Yes, significant groups who had carried out attacks in the past have been weakened. But it seems killers can still unleash mayhem in our midst.\n\nThe message that goes out to the world and to the citizens of Pakistan itself, just as the holy month of Ramazan begins, is not a positive one. It suggests we are still held hostage to militants who use religion for their own purposes. They have not spared a shrine which brings together tens of thousands of believers even during a month that is sacred to Muslims everywhere. This should alert us to the fact that the people who kill are not true believers. Their purposes are different and they are dangerous. They have already created chaos across the country and divided it increasingly along lines of sect, belief, ethnicity, and ideology.

They were all killed after Afghan commandos led an hours-long clearance operation.\n\nDozens of workers could be seen sweeping debris and broken glass from streets in the popular Shahr-e-Naw neighbourhood in central Kabul, which is home to shops, restaurants and hotels.\n\nMeanwhile in the Qatari capital Doha, US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad was leading talks with Taliban officials in a push to end America's nearly 18-year military involvement in Afghanistan.\n\nThe two foes are hammering out a deal that could see foreign forces leave Afghanistan in return for a ceasefire, talks between Kabul and the Taliban, and a guarantee the country will not be used as a safe haven for terror groups.\n\nSeveral critics said Wednesday's attack highlighted the apparent paradox of America asking the Taliban to safeguard Afghanistan from terror groups, when the insurgents themselves employ terror tactics.\n\n\"The 'Taliban' embody crime, which is not amenable to peaceful conflict resolution initiatives,\" Afghanistan's chief executive Abdullah Abdullah said on Twitter.\n\n\"They misinterpret our goodwill as weakness and misuse peace negotiations to seek legitimacy for heinous crimes of the sort they committed yesterday in #Kabul.\"\n\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani last week offered the Taliban a ceasefire beginning on the first day of Ramadan -- but the insurgents refused.\n\nIn May 2017, the Taliban said hurting civilians during Ramadan was a \"crime\", but this year they said jihad was more rewarding during the holy month of fasting and good deeds.", "url": "http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/kabul-aid-groups-reel-after-nine-killed-in-taliban-attack/article/549393", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": "2019-05-09 08:20:21-04:00"}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9998673367747666, "vector": [0.2532765281204339, 0.38440610804261666, 2.0, 3.0], "id": 70115}, {"probability": 0.9972744158558964, "vector": [0.1991786650355562, 0.3414214692338638, 1.0, 2.0], "id": 70140}], "id": "ed26186d-099b-40d0-ba88-e491e7a3331b", "title": "Taliban attack on US-based aid group raises concern in Kabul", "text": "KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) \u2014 A brazen Taliban attack on U.S.-based aid group in the Afghan capital raised concerns Thursday among other relief organizations they could be targeted even as the insurgents hold peace talks with a U.S. envoy.\n\nAuthorities say Wednesday's assault on the Kabul office of Counterpart International, a group that promotes gender equity, killed at least nine people.\n\nThe Taliban set off a huge explosion and battled security forces for over six hours before they were repelled.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid quickly claimed responsibility for the attack, saying Counterpart International was targeted because it promoted the \"inter-mixing\" of men and women.\n\nThe aid group mentored \"Kabul admin workers in various aspects of brutality, oppression, terror, anti-Islamic ideology & promotion of western culture,\" Mujahid said on Twitter. Counterpart was not immediately available to comment, but the group's website says it runs a USAID-funded Afghan civic engagement programme supporting women and other marginalised groups across Afghanistan.

The two foes are hammering out a deal that could see foreign forces leave Afghanistan in return for a ceasefire, talks between the government and the Taliban, and a guarantee the country will not be used as a safe haven for terror groups.

It was once a short form of Archibald, but now many families use it on its own.\n\nFamous Archies include US actor Archie Kao, former NFL star Archie Manning and Archie Andrews \u2014 a red-headed comic book character from the Archie comics.\n\nMiddle name Harrison may derive from \u201cson of Harry\u201d or \u201cson of Henry\u201d, his father\u2019s real name.\n\nHarrison is of English origin, with famous examples including Star Wars actor Harrison Ford \u2014 perhaps evidence of Meghan\u2019s LA acting background.\n\nBookmakers had the name Archie at around 100/1, with Harrison not appearing at all.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor is the surname used by some of the male-line descendants of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nThe names are a far cry from some of the traditional ones predicted, with the progressive royal couple again showing they are happy to modernise.\n\nThe baby was not given a HRH, even though the Queen could have tweaked the rules, as she did for Kate and William\u2019s children, to make him a prince.\n\nMeghan and Harry have also chosen not to give him an aristocratic title, even though he could have been styled as Lord Mountbatten-Windsor and taken one of Prince Harry\u2019s lesser titles, such as Earl of Dumbarton. He will simply be known as Master Archie.\n\nHarry, 34, has previously spoken of how he would like his children to have a relatively normal upbringing.\n\nThe little boy, who was born early on Monday morning local time, could one day inherit the title the Duke of Sussex from Harry.\n\nSome complained of the choice of the short-form of Archibald rather than the full name, while others joked it could be to avoid offending Prince William.

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry welcomed the baby boy on Monday, May 6. After spending some quiet time with family post-delivery, the couple is sharing the new addition with the rest of the world for the first time at Windsor.\n\nDue to the rain, Meghan and Harry posed for photos inside Windsor Castle. When asked about her new son, Meghan adorably told reporters, \"It is magic, and it is pretty amazing. I have the two best guys in the world. And so I am really happy.\"\n\nAs usual, Meghan and Harry proved that they're completely smitten with one another with several sweet moments of PDA. While Harry cradled the royal baby, new mom Meghan was on hand to check on the little one, and gaze adoringly at her husband in the process:\n\nMeghan and Harry announced the arrival of their son hours after the delivery with a celebratory post on Instagram that read, \"It's a boy!\" In the caption, the couple revealed that their baby weighed seven pounds, three ounces at birth.\n\n\"The Duchess and baby are both healthy and well, and the couple thank members of the public for their shared excitement and support during this very special time in their lives,\" they added in the caption.\n\nThe couple took a more private approach than Prince William and Kate Middleton did when welcoming their child. Instead of posing for photos outside of the hospital right after the baby's birth, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex decided not to share delivery plans and kept news of the birth to themselves so they could celebrate quietly with family for the first couple of days.\n\nIn early April, Buckingham Palace released a statement on behalf of the Sussexes that read:\n\nIt's also unlikely we'll see much of Baby Sussex in the near future now that Harry and Meghan have moved out of London and into Frogmore Cottage in Windsor.

Picture: Reuters\n\nDid Prince Harry give away a baby name clue during the announcement of the birth of his son. Picture: Reuters\n\nPRINCE Harry remained tight lipped about potential names for Baby Sussex during his TV announcement yesterday.\n\nBut, according to The Sun, royal fans reckon he gave a cryptic clue about the little boy's name - and it's all down to where he was standing.\n\nThe 34-year-old first-time dad stood outside the stables in the grounds of Windsor Castle, where two horses poked their heads out in the background.\n\nAnd royal watchers reckon the stallions' names - George and Sir John - could be a clue to the royal baby's own moniker.\n\nOf course, Baby Sussex already has a cousin called George - Kate Middleton and Prince William's oldest - meaning his uncle Harry is unlikely to pick this name.\n\nBut the royal name John is yet to be chosen by any member of the modern royal family, meaning it could be a good choice for Meghan and Harry.\n\nSpeaking outside the stables, Harry told the cameras: \"We're still thinking about names.\n\n\"The baby's a little bit overdue, so we've had a bit of time to think about it, but that's the next bit.\n\n\"We'll be seeing you guys in two days' time as planned, so everyone can see the baby.\"\n\nMeghan and Harry are expected to announce their baby name tomorrow - when we're due to get our first glimpse of the newest royal.\n\nRoyals, of course, have a way of taking their time about naming babies and the couple is known to want to do things at their own pace, so it may be a few days before the couple reveals the name for their first child.\n\nBookmakers in Britain reported high interest in the names Alexander, James and Arthur. They also gave a nod to Spencer, the maiden name of Harry's late mother, Princess Diana. Choosing Spencer as a first or middle name is seen as a way for Harry to honour Diana, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997 when he was only 12. He spoke before he married Meghan last year about his desire to pay tribute to her memory during the ceremony.\n\nOthers believe Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, will choose a name that reflects her American heritage.\n\nThe infant, known only as Baby Sussex for the moment, was born early Monday morning. The royal couple has not said if he was born at home or at a hospital. Harry said when he announced the birth Monday that he and Meghan are \"thinking\" about names and hinted that an announcement might be made on Wednesday on shortly thereafter.

And, well, considering he is Harry's first son, it sure makes sense.\n\nBut it seems we may have missed the other secret meaning lurking among baby Archie's moniker - and this one is a nod to his mum, Meghan.\n\nRemember how Meghan's first name isn't actually Meghan, but is Rachel instead? (Sorry to just casually drop that bombshell if you hadn't been aware - oh, and Harry's real name is actually Henry, while we're at it). Well, followers of the @SussexRoyal account were quick to point out that Archie is a very close anagram of 'Rachel' - or as close as you might get without actually calling him Rachel, anyway.\n\nIf this is the thinking behind it, then the two names put together give an even level of devotion to both first-time parents, which is quite sweet really.\n\nAnd it's pretty clear to see how excited both Harry and Meghan are to have Archie in their lives. During a brief interview at the photo call yesterday, Meghan said her son was \"magic\".\n\n\"I have the two best guys in the world so I'm really happy,\" she said, adding that Archie \"has the sweetest temperament.

Picture: Dominic Lipinski/PA\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex with their baby son during a photocall in St George's Hall at Windsor Castle. Picture: Dominic Lipinski/PA\n\nBaby Sussex has finally been named, but royal fans around the world have been left scratching their heads as to where Harry and Meghan got their inspiration for the unusual name.\n\nThe baby boy's name - Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor - was announced to the world hours after he appeared with his parents for a photo call at St George's Hall in Windsor.\n\nAccompanying the statement on Harry and Meghan's Instagram account was a picture of the child meeting his great-grandmother, the Queen, alongside Prince Philip and Meghan's mother Doria Ragland.\n\nThe child will not have a royal title and will be known as \"Master\".\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan have thrown the world a curve ball with their son's non-traditional name, which is a shortened form of Archibald.\n\nA little bit less inspired is the child's second name which literally means \"son of Harry\".\n\nMountbatten-Windsor has been the royal family's surname since the Queen married Prince Philip in 1947.\n\nPrince Philip adopted the surname Mountbatten after his uncle Louis and the Queen decided that her descendants - other than her children or those entitled to use the HRH style - would bear the surname Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nReactions to the child's name have been mixed with many Twitter users questioning why the couple didn't opt for the name's more traditional form.\n\nThings could get a little confusing in the royal household as Prince Harry's nephew, Prince George, is nicknamed Archie, according to The Sun.\n\nThe young prince reportedly told a dog-walker \"I'm called Archie\", while he was out and about with his grandmother Carole Middleton.\n\nIt left royal fans confused as to why that might be his nickname, but the arrival of baby Sussex might provide an explanation.\n\nOne popular theory that has emerged is that Prince George overhead, or was told the name of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's baby months ago, and let the cat out of the bag to passer-by he struck up a conversation with.\n\nBABY SUSSEX COULD BE COMPARED TO RIVERDALE CHARACTER\n\nSpeculation over the latest royal baby's hair colour is yet to be satisfied as he has only been shown in photos wearing a knitted beanie.\n\nIf he does inherit his father's famous red hair, baby Archie will surely be compared another famous redhead bearing the same moniker.\n\nArchie Andrews, of Archie Comics fame, was reinvented in hit television show Riverdale and is played by New Zealand actor KJ Apa.\n\nGiven the Sussexes announced their pregnancy in the lead-up to their New Zealand tour, a nod toward one of their most famous exports would be fitting.\n\nAccording to Baby Centre, the name Archie enjoyed a surge in popularity following the release of the show in 2017 and it is sure to rise even further now it has the royal stamp of approval.\n\nAfter the birth of Prince William and Duchess of Cambridge's youngest son, Prince Louis, 1, his name jumped 17 per cent in popularity.\n\nThe names of his siblings, Princess Charlotte, 4, and Prince George, 5, also jumped significantly in the ranks following their births.\n\nBookies had more traditional names such as Spencer, Alexander and James as front runners, but punters who put their money on Archie will be enjoying a windfall as the name was reportedly at odds of 100/1.\n\nLittle Archie also met his great-grandparents, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, at Windsor Castle.\n\nMeghan's mum, Doria Ragland, who has been by her daughter's side, was also on hand to introduce Archie to the Queen.\n\nMeghan gave birth to the child, who weighed 7 lbs 3oz (3.2kgs), at 5.26am London time (2.26pm AEST) on Monday.\n\nArchie also made his social media debut, with pictures on his parents' Instagram racking up more than 1.5 million likes in a few hours.\n\nEarlier, the world was given its first glimpkse of Archie when he appeared with Harry and Meghan during a photo call at St George's Hall in Windsor Castle..\n\nMeghan looked relaxed, happy and tired. \"It's magic, it's pretty amazing, they are the two best guys in the world, so I'm really happy,\" the Duchess of Sussex said.\n\nWhen asked how he was sleeping, Meghan replied, \"He has the sweetest temperament, he's calm.\"\n\nAs they both laughed, Harry joked, \"I don't know who he gets that from.\"\n\n\"He's just been the dream so it's been a special couple of days,\" Meghan added.\n\nAsked who the baby takes after, Meghan smiled, \"We're still trying to figure that out.\"\n\n\"Everyone says that babies change so much over two weeks we're basically monitoring how the changing process happens over this next month really,\" Harry added. \"But his looks are changing every single day, so who knows.\"\n\nAsked how he found parenting, Harry said, \"It's great. Parenting is amazing.

Especially not now, mere hours after the beaming Duchess of Sussex and her giddy husband enjoyed their first official interview and photo call with their little baby. Despite a whole slew of well wishes and kindness, there remains an insidious need to compare women. And honestly everyone, comparing Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton's postpartum bodies simply cannot be a thing in 2019. It should never have been a thing, but at this point I'm almost certain we are meant to know better than this.\n\nTo recap, Kate Middleton has given birth to three children since marrying her husband Prince William in 2011; 5-year-old son Prince George, 4-year-old daughter Princess Charlotte, and now 1-year-old son Prince Louis.\n\nMeghan Markle has now given birth to her first child, a son named Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, with husband Prince Harry. The couple welcomed little Archie on May 6, and on Wednesday they met with reporters and photographers at Windsor Castle for their first official photo call introducing him to the world.\n\nSo here was what was immediately evident to me: Prince Harry looked like his head might explode if his grin got any wider. Meghan Markle looked serene and excited all at the same time. Baby Archie was hard to see in his father's arms, but I am pretty sure I caught a glimpse of chubby cheeks and aren't those just the best? I mean, look at that little nose...\n\nUnfortunately there were far too many people out there looking for something else. Looking to compare Markle's postpartum body with that of her sister-in-law Kate Middleton.\n\nSeveral media outlets also shared articles comparing the Duchess of Sussex and the Duchess of Cambridge's postpartum appearances, focusing on their outfits but also on their post-birth \"looks.\" While not overtly calling out either of their bodies necessarily, the message is clear: these two women have been thrown into a competition neither of them chose and everything about them will be assessed, even in those tender hours after giving birth.\n\nOf course, social media users aren't required to be as subtle. It seems there are two camps, either Team Kate or Team Meghan, and they have decided it is impossible to be supportive of both women and their postpartum bodies.\n\nMeghan Markle's postpartum body doesn't need to be a statement any more than Kate Middleton's was after she gave birth. Their bodies are simply their own and have nothing to do with one another.\n\nThe reality is, it's hard enough to walk out in front of dozens of photographers after giving birth. Your body is tired and sore and feels rather foreign to you. The last thing any woman needs is to be compared to anyone else, favorably or otherwise.\n\nIt turns out you can actually like and admire both Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton at the same time, folks. We need to stop this either/or thing we do with women at some point and I don't know about you but I'm ready for this to be that point right now, OK?", "url": "https://www.romper.com/p/people-comparing-meghan-markle-kate-middletons-postpartum-bodies-needs-to-stop-17856422", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": "2019-05-08 18:35:10.681000+00:00"}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9999148434623093, "vector": [0.30124341217220596, 0.6253836961324797, 0.0, 1.0], "id": 70117}], "id": "1d134b5b-31fc-4944-9940-7956a6091fcd", "title": "Prince Harry returns to work three days after birth of his son Archie", "text": "The Duke of Sussex will take a break from parenting today to travel to the Netherlands, just three days after the birth of his son Archie.\n\nPrince Harry will visit The Hague to launch the one-year countdown to the Invictus Games 2020, after introducing Archie to the world alongside Meghan in an eagerly anticipated photocall on Wednesday.\n\nThe duchess is likely to still have the company of her mother Doria Ragland at their Frogmore Cottage home while Harry is away on the short trip.\n\nLeading parenting expert Suzie Hayman said Harry is likely to find leaving his baby son so soon after his birth 'agonising', and said he would feel a 'pang' to be leaving his wife and child.\n\nHarry and Meghan announced they had called their baby Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor after the duchess movingly described her son and husband as 'the two best guys in the world'.\n\nThe couple broke with royal convention by not using a title for their baby boy, and have given their firstborn a name familiar to fans of the American Archie comic - featuring a main character who has red hair just like the duke.\n\nThe new parents were pictured showing off baby Archie to the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, alongside Ms Ragland, at Windsor Castle.\n\nHarry and Meghan's first born, who is seventh in line to the throne, made his debut with his mother and father at the castle on Wednesday.\n\nThe duchess described her son as having the 'sweetest temperament', while a delighted duke called him 'our own little bundle of joy'.\n\nMeghan added: 'It's magic, it's pretty amazing.

They were keeping it hidden, not telling us because they were MESSING WITH OUR MINDS, they speculated. They are selfish, she is a control freak, they are sticking their fingers up to royal protocol, it was claimed.\n\nOr it could be - what it in fact was - she simply hadn't had her baby yet. Her baby, note. Not ours, we don't actually own it.\n\nMeghan has been under fire at every stage of her pregnancy, so it's little wonder she and Harry chose to keep some of the details quiet.\n\nFirst, she was \"breaking royal tradition\" by not choosing to give birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, which isn't royal tradition at all, but was the hospital some mothers-to-be including Diana, Princess of Wales, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge used during their labours. Many members of the Royal Family have given birth in other hospitals - Sophie, Countess of Wessex in Frimley Park Hospital, and Zara Tindall in Stroud Maternity Unit. Neither were accused of \"breaking royal tradition.\" But that doesn't fit the narrative.\n\nMeghan eventually gave birth at The Portland Hospital in London's West End, which is also where Sarah, Duchess of York delivered her daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.\n\nAlthough no details have been confirmed, it looks like she was trying for a home birth but ended up in a private hospital, which means the British press flip-flopped from thinking her a yoga-loving hippy to ultimate Hollywood diva.\n\nTuesday's newspapers breathlessly reported the hospital costs upwards of $28,000 and gives you Molton Brown toiletries and lobster. But on behalf of mothers everywhere, let me make it clear: Ryan Reynolds could spritz you with Molton Brown fragrance while feeding you lobster and it wouldn't make childbirth any more enjoyable an experience.\n\nWhen Meghan finally conceded to have her baby, she had the cheek not to tell everybody exactly when, where and how. Admittedly, it was perplexing that Buckingham Palace issued a statement that she was in labour when she had already had the baby, but again, not all royal mothers give out detailed press releases. Perhaps people were expecting them to live tweet the birth and post the video on YouTube.\n\nPiers Morgan - Meghan's biggest critic ever since she ghosted him - called it a \"petulant act of defiance\", writing, \"part of the deal of being a prince is that you share your happy family stuff with the public. It's what you do in return for all the palaces, servants and endless luxuries that go with the title - much of which is paid for by the taxpayer.\"\n\nThe final \"flout of tradition\" came over the official announcement written on parchment and placed on an easel outside Buckingham Palace. It went up without listing her doctors, and some two hours after Meghan and Harry posted the news on Instagram. They were wrong for that, too, as really, who wouldn't wait for a calligrapher to creak through the corridors of Buckingham Palace with their quill?\n\nEven the appearance of a euphoric-looking Harry describing the birth as, \"the most amazing experience I could ever have possibly imagined,\" didn't stop allegations of him \"manipulating the press.\"\n\nPerhaps for the next one we should go back to the good old days where a crowd watches a royal birth, including the Home Secretary.

It turns out Markle and Prince Harry wanted something a little different for their child.\n\nA source close to the duke and duchess tells ELLE.com the couple was keen on a \"modern name\" that still respected royal tradition. As for why Archie specifically, well, the answer is simple.\n\n\"There was no special meaning behind the name; the couple just loved it,\" the source tells ELLE.com. That's about as relatable of a reason as ever.\n\nAnd it's in line with what royals expert Katie Nicholl told Glamour a few weeks ago about Baby Sussex's name. \"I heard Meghan might want to go down the more modern route; they might want a more American name. But I think they will be respectful of royal traditions,\" she said. \"There are no strict rules at all. There's no rule stipulating they must name a royal child after other royals.\"\n\nA few eyebrows were raised when it was revealed Markle and Prince Harry decided to forego a courtesy title (like \"Prince\") for Archie, but Nicholl also called this in our interview.\n\n\"Harry is a man who, as a young boy, resented being a prince, resented the weighted burden that came with his title,\" Nicholl told Glamour. \"I think it's very unlikely he's going to want a title for his child. I think Lord or Lady is probably more than good enough for the Sussexes.\"\n\nArchie does have the title \"Master\" right now, but this could change when Prince Charles becomes king. All of the grandchildren under the current monarch have an HRH title, so it's possible Archie will fall in line when the time comes. Or Markle and Prince Harry could stay firm in their decision.\n\nJoe Little, a royal history expert and editor at Majesty magazine, says (per ELLE), \"When Charles becomes King, his grandchildren will, where necessary, automatically be upgraded to Royal Highness and Prince/Princess. But perhaps Harry and Meghan will do what Prince Edward and Sophie have done and choose not to 'burden' their children with such styles and titles.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that Queen Elizabeth II could issue a new \"Letters Patent\" to ensure all of Prince Harry's children receive royal titles\u2014so if she hasn't done this yet, it's probably because Prince Harry and Meghan Markle don't want her to.\n\nPrince or not, one thing is certain: Archie is a total cutie.", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/why-meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-decided-to-name-their-son-archie", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": "2019-05-08 22:14:57.304000+00:00"}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9999799199587638, "vector": [0.42234510726513175, 0.7243783864760232, 0.0, 0.0], "id": 70117}], "id": "8807b308-f479-4ec9-b4bd-c46ea10ecf93", "title": "Royal fans joke their pets share a name with Meghan and Harry's son", "text": "Royal fans flocked to social media after Meghan Markle and Prince Harry announced the name of their son - Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nThe baby boy will not have a royal title like his cousins, the Cambridge's children, but will be known simply as Master Archie.\n\nThe name, which wasn't a bookies favourite, has generally gone down well with fans - especially because it contains a touching tribute to the little one's father Prince Harry.\n\nMany were quick to pick up on the significance of the baby's middle name Harrison, the origin of which is 'son of Harry', or 'Harry's son'.\n\nBut a great deal of people claimed the Royal Baby has been named after their dogs - with Archie proving to be a very popular moniker for pet hounds.\n\nBemused dog owners shared photos of their pets, thanking the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for the 'tribute'.\n\nOne tweeted: 'I'm pleased to announce that Meghan and Harry have honoured us by naming their child after our dog, Archie,' followed by a picture of the cute mutt.\n\nAnother shared a photo of their West Highland White Terrier perched on a union jack cushion, captioning the picture: 'Personally I think my boy Archie is more regal.'\n\nAnother one joked: '#Archie doesn't seem too bothered that Harry and Meghan have given their baby his name.

Picture: Dominic Lipinski/PA\n\nBaby Sussex has finally been named, but royal fans around the world have been left scratching their heads as to where Harry and Meghan got their inspiration for the unusual name.\n\nThe baby boy's name - Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor - was announced to the world hours after he appeared with his parents for a photo call at St George's Hall in Windsor.\n\nAccompanying the statement on Harry and Meghan's Instagram account was a picture of the child meeting his great-grandmother, the Queen, alongside Prince Philip and Meghan's mother Doria Ragland.\n\nThe child will not have a royal title and will be known as \"Master\".\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan have thrown the world a curve ball with their son's non-traditional name, which is a shortened form of Archibald.\n\nA little bit less inspired is the child's second name which literally means \"son of Harry\".\n\nMountbatten-Windsor has been the royal family's surname since the Queen married Prince Philip in 1947.\n\nPrince Philip adopted the surname Mountbatten after his uncle Louis and the Queen decided that her descendants - other than her children or those entitled to use the HRH style - would bear the surname Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nReactions to the child's name have been mixed with many Twitter users questioning why the couple didn't opt for the name's more traditional form.\n\nThings could get a little confusing in the royal household as Prince Harry's nephew, Prince George, is nicknamed Archie, according to The Sun.\n\nThe young prince reportedly told a dog-walker \"I'm called Archie\", while he was out and about with his grandmother Carole Middleton.\n\nIt left royal fans confused as to why that might be his nickname, but the arrival of baby Sussex might provide an explanation.\n\nOne popular theory that has emerged is that Prince George overhead, or was told the name of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's baby months ago, and let the cat out of the bag to passer-by he struck up a conversation with.\n\nBABY SUSSEX COULD BE COMPARED TO RIVERDALE CHARACTER\n\nSpeculation over the latest royal baby's hair colour is yet to be satisfied as he has only been shown in photos wearing a knitted beanie.\n\nIf he does inherit his father's famous red hair, baby Archie will surely be compared another famous redhead bearing the same moniker.\n\nArchie Andrews, of Archie Comics fame, was reinvented in hit television show Riverdale and is played by New Zealand actor KJ Apa.\n\nGiven the Sussexes announced their pregnancy in the lead-up to their New Zealand tour, a nod toward one of their most famous exports would be fitting.\n\nAccording to Baby Centre, the name Archie enjoyed a surge in popularity following the release of the show in 2017 and it is sure to rise even further now it has the royal stamp of approval.\n\nAfter the birth of Prince William and Duchess of Cambridge's youngest son, Prince Louis, 1, his name jumped 17 per cent in popularity.\n\nThe names of his siblings, Princess Charlotte, 4, and Prince George, 5, also jumped significantly in the ranks following their births.\n\nBookies had more traditional names such as Spencer, Alexander and James as front runners, but punters who put their money on Archie will be enjoying a windfall as the name was reportedly at odds of 100/1.\n\nLittle Archie also met his great-grandparents, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, at Windsor Castle.\n\nMeghan's mum, Doria Ragland, who has been by her daughter's side, was also on hand to introduce Archie to the Queen.\n\nMeghan gave birth to the child, who weighed 7 lbs 3oz (3.2kgs), at 5.26am London time (2.26pm AEST) on Monday.\n\nArchie also made his social media debut, with pictures on his parents' Instagram racking up more than 1.5 million likes in a few hours.\n\nEarlier, the world was given its first glimpkse of Archie when he appeared with Harry and Meghan during a photo call at St George's Hall in Windsor Castle..\n\nMeghan looked relaxed, happy and tired. \"It's magic, it's pretty amazing, they are the two best guys in the world, so I'm really happy,\" the Duchess of Sussex said.\n\nWhen asked how he was sleeping, Meghan replied, \"He has the sweetest temperament, he's calm.\"\n\nAs they both laughed, Harry joked, \"I don't know who he gets that from.\"\n\n\"He's just been the dream so it's been a special couple of days,\" Meghan added.\n\nAsked who the baby takes after, Meghan smiled, \"We're still trying to figure that out.\"\n\n\"Everyone says that babies change so much over two weeks we're basically monitoring how the changing process happens over this next month really,\" Harry added. \"But his looks are changing every single day, so who knows.\"\n\nAsked how he found parenting, Harry said, \"It's great. Parenting is amazing. It's only been two and a half days, three days, but we're just so thrilled to have our own little bundle of joy and be able to spend some precious times with him as he slowly, slowly starts to grow up.\"\n\nAsked about going to see the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, Meghan said, \"We just bumped into the Duke as we were walking by which was so nice. So it'll be a nice moment to introduce the baby to more family and my mum's with us as well.\"\n\nAsked to show more of their son's face to the cameras, Meghan laughed as Harry joked, \"He's already got a little bit of facial hair as well, wonderful.\"\n\nMeghan also had a message for the public.\n\n\"Thank you everybody for all the well-wishes and kindness, it just means so much.\"\n\nThe photocall took place in St George's Hall at Windsor Castle.\n\nMeghan wore a white dress, while Harry was in a grey suit, white shirt and black tie.\n\nWhile little Archie met his great-grandparents, he'll have to wait a bit longer to meet his grandfather.\n\nPrince Charles and Camilla were in Berlin on official duties.\n\nThe proud grandfather spoke in both German and English and he gushed about his new grandson, his fourth grandchild.\n\n\"Of course it is also a particular pleasure to be back in Berlin once again - especially as the grandfather of a brand new grandson,\" he said in both languages.\n\nHe said earlier in the day when meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel: \"We couldn't be more delighted at the news and we're looking forward to meeting the baby when we return.\"\n\nPrince William and Catherine, who live about 40 minutes' drive from Windsor, were also thrilled, but were yet to see their new nephew who was born at 5.26am (2.26pm AEST) on Monday local time.\n\n\"We're absolutely thrilled and looking forward to seeing them in the next few days when things have quietened down,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm pleased to welcome my brother to the sleep deprivation society that is parenting.\"\n\nWilliam said he had \"plenty of advice\" for Harry about fatherhood but just wanted him to enjoy the moment.\n\nCatherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, said: \"It's such a special time with (her children) Louis and Charlotte just having birthdays - it's such a great time of year to have a baby. Spring is in the air, it's really great.\"\n\nShe wished them all the best.\n\n\"These next few weeks are always a bit daunting the first time around,\" the mother-of-three added.\n\nThere has been no official or unofficial \"wetting of the baby's head\", but punters at the Prince Harry Hotel in Windsor, just a five-minute walk from Frogmore Cottage, have been celebrating on the royal couple's behalf.", "url": "https://www.thechronicle.com.au/news/royal-baby-meghan-markle-prince-harry-to-reveal-so/3722085/", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": "2020-10-06 11:42:49.457367+00:00"}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9478079093686479, "vector": [0.0, 0.5005903139756741, 0.0, 0.0], "id": 70117}], "id": "38437be4-c987-4253-b580-61dcaa08bbe2", "title": "Wool wrap for royal baby suggests tradition will win out", "text": "Wool wrap for royal baby suggests tradition will win out\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor slept through his first press conference, but royal experts say the merino wool wrap in which he snuggled said a lot about how his parents, Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, will approach his future.\n\nMeghan, a former TV star, is known for promoting social causes and niche brands with her clothing choices.

Both were made by English firm G.H. Hurt & Son, which has supplied three generations of royal babies with knitwear.\n\n\"It's pretty amazing,\" said the 37-year-old American, formerly known as Meghan Markle. \"I have the two best guys in the world, so I'm really happy.\"\n\nShe said the baby \u2014 born Monday at 5:26 a.m. weighing 7 pounds, 3 ounces (3.26 kilograms) \u2014 had \"just been a dream.\"\n\n\"He has the sweetest temperament. He's really calm,\" she said.\n\nHarry quipped: \"I wonder who he gets that from.\"\n\nAsked who the baby took after, Harry said it was too soon to tell.\n\n\"Everyone says that babies change so much over two weeks,\" said the 34-year-old prince. \"We're basically monitoring how the changing process happens over this next month really. But his looks are changing every single day, so who knows.\n\n\"We're just so thrilled to have our own little bundle of joy,\" he added.\n\nThe couple left the photo call to introduce the baby to his great-grandparents, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. The infant is the eighth great-grandchild of 93-year-old Elizabeth, Britain's longest reigning monarch.\n\nMeghan's mother, Doria Ragland, is staying with the couple at their Frogmore Cottage home near the queen's Windsor Castle residence.\n\nThe baby is the first Anglo-American member of the royal family, and is eligible for U.S. citizenship should his parents want it. He has African-American heritage though his biracial mother.\n\nFamily members have welcomed the new arrival with Prince William, Harry's older brother and a father of three, joking Tuesday that he will be glad \"to welcome my own brother into the sleep deprivation society that is parenting!\"\n\n\"Obviously thrilled, absolutely thrilled, and obviously looking forward to seeing them in the next few days,\" William told reporters.\n\nMeghan, the former star of the TV show \"Suits,\" married Harry, the ex-soldier younger son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, in May 2018. An audience of millions around the world watched the spectacular televised wedding ceremony at Windsor Castle, 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of London.\n\nHarry is due to return to royal duties Thursday, attending an event in The Hague for the Invictus Games sports competition for injured service personnel and veterans. Harry is likely to make the jaunt to the Netherlands as a day trip so he can get back to his family in Windsor.\n\nThis story has corrected the baby's name to Archie, not Archibald.

Women praised her for not hiding in a flowy dress or trying to suck everything in with shapewear.\n\nThe royals are clearly taking a step into modern times by breaking with tradition, as The Duke and Duchess of Sussex did by not appearing right away with Baby Sussex on the hospital steps for photos.

READ MORE: Where does the name Archie Harrison come from?\n\nWhy is Meghan and Harry\u2019s child a Mountbatten-Windsor? Prince William and Kate\u2019s children have all inherited prince and princess titles from their father, but only because he is a direct heir to the throne. Since Prince Harry is sixth-in-line to the throne, meaning Archie takes no title and inherits the Mountbatten-Windsor surname used by descendants of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The surname is applied when the Royal Family member has no other higher title.\n\nMost family members only use the Mountbatten-Windsor name where a surname might be required, such as on official personal documents. The first use of the name came after the birth of Lady Louise Windsor in 2003, as the Queen decided the children Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones would not have the title of His or Her Royal Highness. Instead, Lady Louise was given the surname Mountbatten Windsor. Since Harry and Meghan decided they would not give Archie Harrison a title, he has also adopted the surname.

It was most likely that Harry was cradling the baby for the photo shoot simply because that is just how they roll and nobody thought that the royal convention was for the mother to hold the baby for these photographs. Outside the private Lindo Wing at St Mary\u2019s, William has been photographed standing next to his wife and child at each birth. In 1977 Princess Anne thanked hospital staff while a nurse held her infant son, Peter Phillips.\n\nAnn Douglas, a best-selling Canadian parenting and baby author, said yesterday\u2019s photocall heralded a new generation of feminist royals who would share parenting duties between them. The Cambridges might disagree of course \u2013 William is certainly a hands-on father but it is Kate who more normally builds her days and weeks around being available for the children. Ms Douglas said: \u201cI think we can take away from this morning that Harry intends to take a really active role in parenting, and that he recognises parenting as a gift, rather than an obligation. \u201cHe intends to treat parenting as something he does jointly with Meghan but it\u2019s going to be at the centre of his life, because you get the sense that this is something he\u2019s been building towards.\u201d\n\nShe praised the couple\u2019s equal banter in front of the cameras, which she said showed there no hierarchy between them. \u201cThey weren\u2019t doing stiff upper lip, formal signalling stuff you might have seen in the past,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were saying: \u2018we\u2019re doing this differently, we\u2019re a different generation of royals, we\u2019re a different generation of parents, and we want to share our baby with you too.\u201d Little Archie may have a pampered life compared to most but for a few moments yesterday his mother and father looked like parents around the entire planet coming to terms with the way their world had changed in just a few hours. For Meghan, her guy had turned into \u201cmy guys\u201d.\n\nMeghan and Harry have a style all of their own MEGHAN and Harry have spent the past year pushing the boundaries of traditional Royal practice, Rivkie Baum So the Duchess of Sussex shunned the very public birth and baby reveal that her sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge had to endure. Instead she opted for a much more controlled affair that allowed her and Harry some precious time alone with their first-born. When Meghan did emerge, she was wearing her faithful \u00a3495 flesh-toned Manolo Blahnik heels in a bid to match Harry\u2019s towering frame. Whether it was her understandable nerves or the new father\u2019s boundless enthusiasm, it was Harry who took charge and carried sleeping baby Archie for his first photocall.\n\nHer white coat dress revealed something of a uniform choice, as she favours both tailored styles and the angelic hue for key public moments. She opted for similar looks for her engagement announcement and her first trip to Royal Ascot. The fitted white trench coat dress by British designer Grace Wales Bonner, which is not available to buy online, featured double-breasted button detailing. By belting the dress above her bump the Duchess sent a message to all women that the post-birth \u201csnap back into shape\u201d should be the last thing on any new mother\u2019s mind.", "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1125073/royal-baby-archie-parents-duke-duchess-sussex", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": "2019-05-09 16:32:00+01:00"}], "summary": "Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, name their son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor.", "wiki_links": ["/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "/wiki/Archie_Mountbatten-Windsor"], "category": "Arts and culture"}

The accord signed by Iran, Russia, China, Britain, France, Germany and the United States, put limits on Tehran\u2019s disputed nuclear program in return for the lifting of some sanctions.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani announced changes on Wednesday that experts said seemed tailored to ensure Tehran avoids triggering the deal\u2019s mechanism to punish it for violations, at least for now. The main new measure that takes effect now would have limited practical impact: a halt to Iran\u2019s sales of enriched uranium and heavy water to other countries.\n\nThe deal allows such sales so Iran can keep reducing its stockpiles below maximum thresholds, but Washington already effectively barred the sales with a sanctions move last week. For now, Iran\u2019s stockpile of enriched uranium is still well below the deal\u2019s cap and heavy water is less sensitive.\n\n\u201cThe Iranian people and the world should know that today is not the end of the JCPOA,\u201d Rouhani said in a televised address, using the acronym for the nuclear deal. \u201cThese are actions in line with the JCPOA.\u201d\n\nRouhani also threatened that in 60 days Iran would resume enrichment of uranium beyond the low fissile purity - suitable for civilian nuclear power generation - allowed under the deal, unless the five other powers signed up to it found a way to protect Iran\u2019s oil and banking industries from U.S. sanctions.\n\nTehran halting compliance with some elements of the nuclear deal was \u201cnothing less than nuclear blackmail of Europe,\u201d Tim Morrison, special assistant to the U.S. president and senior director for weapons of mass destruction, told a conference.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for the community of nations to strongly condemn Iran\u2019s nuclear misconduct and increase pressure on the regime to comply with U.S. demands,\u201d Morrison said.\n\nMorrison said the United States would move quickly against any attempt by European countries to undermine Washington\u2019s sanctions pressure on Iran. He advised them against using the so-called Special Purpose Vehicle to facilitate non-dollar trade to circumvent U.S. sanctions.\n\nFrom this month, Washington has effectively ordered countries worldwide to stop buying Iranian oil or face sanctions of their own. The Trump administration has revoked waivers that had allowed some countries to continue buying Iranian oil and it aims to reduce Iranian crude exports to zero.\n\nWashington has also blacklisted Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group. Iran responded with threats to close the Gulf\u2019s Strait of Hormuz - the conduit for about a third of the world\u2019s seaborne oil exports - if its ships were blocked there.\n\n\u201cWe have made our focus diplomatic isolation and economic pressure and that policy is working,\u201d Brian Hook, Special Envoy for Iran, said in a briefing. Hook said that more nations now, compared with a year ago, were in agreement with the United States on Iran.\n\nWashington\u2019s European allies opposed Trump\u2019s decision to pull out and have tried, so far in vain, to find ways to blunt the economic impact of new U.S. sanctions, which include an all-out effort to block Iran\u2019s oil exports to throttle its economy.\n\nFrance and Germany both said they wanted to keep the nuclear deal alive, and warned Iran not to violate it.\n\n\u201cIt is important to avoid any action that would impede the implementation of their obligations by the parties now engaged in the accord or that would fuel an escalation,\u201d deputy foreign ministry spokesman Olivier Gauvin said in a statement.\n\nRussia and Iran both blamed the United States for what they portrayed as Tehran\u2019s forced decision to suspend some pledges under the nuclear deal, while putting the onus on European powers to guarantee sanctions relief for Iran.\n\nChina said the deal should continue to be implemented and called on all sides to exercise restraint and pursue dialogue.\n\nThe weeks leading up to the anniversary of Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the agreement have seen a sharp tightening of U.S. sanctions and an increase in tensions on other fronts.\n\nWashington announced the deployment of an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the Middle East to counter what it says are \u201cclear indications\u201d of Iranian threats to U.S. forces there.\n\nThe looming total ban on oil sales is likely to sharply increase the economic hardship for Iran\u2019s 80 million people.

Plan of Action (JCPOA), with further measures threatened if the agreement\u2019s other signatories fail to mitigate the impact of renewed American sanctions within 60 days.\n\nExperts said Iran\u2019s announcement has come in reaction to domestic pressure over the crippling impact of US sanctions.\n\nRather than a serious escalation of its nuclear program, it is being read as a way of putting pressure on the other signatories \u2014 notably Germany, France and the UK.\n\nEllie Geranmayeh of the European Council on Foreign Relations said that Tehran\u2019s announcement was a \u201creal warning shot\u201d, showing a shift from an approach \u201cof strategic patience to strategic action\u201d.\n\nRobert Kelley, who previously worked in the US\u2019s nuclear weapons program and is now at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), said Iran\u2019s announcement was a measure \u201cto save face\u201d.\n\nIran needs neither more enriched uranium stocks nor the heavy water \u2014 as they don\u2019t have a reactor that uses heavy water anymore \u2014 while new US sanctions prevented it from selling any excess, he added.\n\nMr Kelley said that, despite the announcement, there would be \u201can infinite way\u201d to go for Iran to build a weapon as, for one, it requires uranium enriched to a much higher degree, and Iran is under daily inspections by the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, which monitors the deal\u2019s implementation.\n\n\u201cAs long as everything is under IAEA safeguards and inspected daily, everyone will know exactly what is going on,\u201d said Mr Kelley, a former director of IAEA nuclear inspections.\n\nThe IAEA would find out \u201cwithin a week\u201d when the stocks of enriched uranium and heavy water had exceeded the prescribed limits, he said.\n\nIn their first reactions, Britain, Germany and France have already condemned Iran\u2019s announcement, urging it to uphold the nuclear pact.\n\nMs Geranmayeh said it was unlikely deal signatories would reinstate sanctions on Iran at this point.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing to be gained at the moment by the Europeans joining the maximum pressure campaign of the United States other than potential military conflict on their doorstep,\u201d she said.\n\nBut if they didn\u2019t want Iran to break further commitments, deal signatories would have to step up their game, she added.\n\nThat for example could mean pressuring Washington to lift sanctions and implementing INSTEX, a trade mechanism Britain, France and Germany introduced in January to allow Tehran to keep trading with EU companies bypassing US sanctions.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has accused in particular the European signatories of not fulfilling their obligations under the deal, issuing \u201cgood statements\u201d but not following through with action.\n\nThe UK\u2019s former ambassador to Tehran, Richard Dalton, said how the deal could continue to exist was not clear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not yet clear whether the European governments feel they can do anything in the next 60 days that they have been unable to do in the last 365,\u201d said Mr Dalton, now

(US national security adviser) John Bolton starting a war with Iran whose repercussions to Europe will be far greater than that of the Iraq war,\u201d Parsi said in a statement.\n\nMr Dalton said the US could yet succeed in making the deal collapse.\n\n\u201cNot only is the United States destroying the EU\u2019s economic sovereignty \u2014 and acting directly against EU security interests and

under a landmark 2015 deal unless other powers help Tehran bypass renewed US sanctions, amid rising tensions with Washington.\n\nThe move was part of a package of measures announced by Iran in response to the sweeping unilateral sanctions reimposed by Washington in the 12 months since it quit the agreement, which have had a severe effect on the Iranian economy.\n\nThey came as Washington stepped up its war of words against Tehran, with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo making a hastily organized visit to neighboring Iraq where he accused Iran of planning \"imminent\" attacks.\n\nAdding to the tensions, Washington announced it was deploying an aircraft carrier strike group with several nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to the Middle East and national security adviser John Bolton warned Washington would respond with \"unrelenting force\" to any attack by Tehran.\n\nUnder the landmark deal agreed by US President Donald Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, the six parties to the agreement were supposed to lift nuclear-related sanctions on Iran in return for it reining in its nuclear activities to ease fears it was seeking the capability to produce an atomic

commercial repercussions.\n\nIran warned that if the five other parties to the agreement \u2013 Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia \u2013 failed to deliver on their commitments within 60 days to help Tehran benefit from the deal despite the US sanctions, it would suspend other key limits set by the deal.\n\nIran's Supreme National Security Council said the measures were necessary to \"secure its rights and bring back balance\" after the unilateral moves by the Trump administration.\n\n\"The Islamic Republic of Iran does not at the current stage consider itself committed to observing restrictions regarding storing enriched uranium stocks and heavy water stocks,\" the Supreme National Security Council said.\n\n\"The remaining parties to the (deal) are given 60 days to implement their commitments, in particular in the fields of banking and oil,\" the council added.\n\n\"In the next stage Iran will also stop observing restrictions on the level of uranium enrichment and measures regarding modernising Arak heavy water reactor.\"\n\nUranium enriched to much higher levels than Iran's current stocks can be used as the fissile core of a nuclear weapon, while heavy water is a source of plutonium which can be used an alternative way to produce a warhead.\n\nThe deal restricted Iran from enriching uranium to more than 3.67 percent, the level commonly used in power generation, and barred it from building additional heavy water reactors or accumulating stocks of more than 130 tonnes of heavy water.\n\nIran will resume implementing its commitments \"in the same level\" as the other parties to the deal respect theirs, the council said.\n\nIt called for swift action by the 5 governments, warning that time was running out to rescue the deal.\n\n\"The window

For now, Iran\u2019s stockpile of enriched uranium is still well below the deal\u2019s cap and heavy water is less sensitive.\n\n\u201cThe Iranian people and the world should know that today is not the end of the JCPOA,\u201d Rouhani said in a televised address, using the acronym for the nuclear deal. \u201cThese are actions in line with the JCPOA.\u201d\n\nRouhani also threatened that in 60 days Iran would resume enrichment of uranium beyond the low fissile purity - suitable for civilian nuclear power generation - allowed under the deal, unless the five other powers signed up to it found a way to protect Iran\u2019s oil and banking industries from U.S. sanctions.\n\nTehran halting compliance with some elements of the nuclear deal was \u201cnothing less than nuclear blackmail of Europe,\u201d Tim Morrison, special assistant to the U.S. president and senior director for weapons of mass destruction, told a conference.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for the community of nations to strongly condemn Iran\u2019s nuclear misconduct and increase pressure on the regime to comply with U.S. demands,\u201d Morrison said.\n\nMorrison said the United States would move quickly against any attempt by European countries to undermine Washington\u2019s sanctions pressure on Iran. He advised them against using the so-called Special Purpose Vehicle to facilitate non-dollar trade to circumvent U.S. sanctions.\n\nFrom this month, Washington has effectively ordered countries worldwide to stop buying Iranian oil or face sanctions of their own. The Trump administration has revoked waivers that had allowed some countries to continue buying Iranian oil and it aims to reduce Iranian crude exports to zero.\n\nWashington has also blacklisted Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group. Iran responded with threats to close the Gulf\u2019s Strait of Hormuz - the conduit for about a third of the world\u2019s seaborne oil exports - if its ships were blocked there.\n\n\u201cWe have made our focus diplomatic isolation and economic pressure and that policy is working,\u201d Brian Hook, Special Envoy for Iran, said in a briefing. Hook said that more nations now, compared with a year ago, were in agreement with the United States on Iran.\n\nWashington\u2019s European allies opposed Trump\u2019s decision to pull out and have tried, so far in vain, to find ways to blunt the economic impact of new U.S. sanctions, which include an all-out effort to block Iran\u2019s oil exports to throttle its economy.\n\nFrance and Germany both said they wanted to keep the nuclear deal alive, and warned Iran not to violate it.\n\n\u201cIt is important to avoid any action that would impede the implementation of their obligations by the parties now engaged in the accord or that would fuel an escalation,\u201d deputy foreign ministry spokesman Olivier Gauvin said in a statement.\n\nRussia and Iran both blamed the United States for what they portrayed as Tehran\u2019s forced decision to suspend some pledges under the nuclear deal, while putting the onus on European powers to guarantee sanctions relief for Iran.\n\nChina said the deal should continue to be implemented and called on all sides to exercise restraint and pursue dialogue.\n\nThe looming total ban on oil sales is likely to sharply increase the economic hardship for Iran\u2019s 80 million people.

came exactly a year after the US withdrew from the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), with further measures threatened if the agreement\u2019s other signatories fail to mitigate the impact of renewed American sanctions within 60 days.\n\nExperts said Iran\u2019s announcement has come in reaction to domestic pressure over the crippling impact of US sanctions.\n\nRather than a serious escalation of its nuclear program, it is being read as a way of putting pressure on the other signatories \u2014 notably Germany, France and the UK.\n\nEllie Geranmayeh of the European Council on Foreign Relations said that Tehran\u2019s announcement was a \u201creal warning shot\u201d, showing a shift from an approach \u201cof strategic patience to strategic action\u201d.\n\nRobert Kelley, who previously worked in the US\u2019s nuclear weapons program and is now at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), said Iran\u2019s announcement was a measure \u201cto save face\u201d.\n\nIran needs neither more enriched uranium stocks nor the heavy water \u2014 as they don\u2019t have a reactor that uses heavy water anymore \u2014 while new US sanctions prevented it from selling any excess, he added.\n\nMr Kelley said that, despite the announcement, there would be \u201can infinite way\u201d to go for Iran to build a weapon as, for one, it requires uranium enriched to a much higher degree, and Iran is under daily inspections by the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, which monitors the deal\u2019s implementation.\n\n\u201cAs long as everything is under IAEA safeguards and inspected daily, everyone will know exactly what is going on,\u201d said Mr Kelley, a former director of IAEA nuclear inspections.\n\nThe IAEA would find out \u201cwithin a week\u201d when the stocks of enriched uranium and heavy water had exceeded the prescribed limits, he said.\n\nIn their first reactions, Britain, Germany and France have already condemned Iran\u2019s announcement, urging it to uphold the nuclear pact.\n\nMs Geranmayeh said it was unlikely deal signatories would reinstate sanctions on Iran at this point.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing to be gained at the moment by the Europeans joining the maximum pressure campaign of the United States other than potential military conflict on their doorstep,\u201d she said.\n\nBut if they didn\u2019t want Iran to break further commitments, deal signatories would have to step up their game, she added.\n\nThat for example could mean pressuring Washington to lift sanctions and implementing INSTEX, a trade mechanism Britain, France and Germany introduced in January to allow Tehran to keep trading with EU companies bypassing US sanctions.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has accused in particular the European signatories of not fulfilling their obligations under the deal, issuing \u201cgood statements\u201d but not following through with action.\n\nThe UK\u2019s former ambassador to Tehran, Richard Dalton, said how the deal could continue to exist was not clear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not yet clear whether the European governments feel they can do anything in the next 60 days that they have been unable to do in the last 365,\u201d said Mr Dalton, now president of the British Iranian Chamber of Commerce.\n\nTrita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council and a vocal supporter of the agreement, said Europe was in a \u201cdifficult spot\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf it fulfils its obligations under the nuclear deal, it will face costly tensions with Washington.\u201d\n\nBut if the EU toes the American line, it would \u201cface the risk of (US national security adviser) John Bolton starting a war with Iran whose repercussions to Europe will be far greater than that of the Iraq war,\u201d Parsi said in a statement.\n\nMr Dalton said the US could yet succeed in making the deal collapse.\n\n\u201cNot only is the United States destroying the EU\u2019s economic sovereignty \u2014 and acting directly against EU security interests and global non proliferation \u2014 but

It means ordinary Iranians see no economic benefits from Rouhani\u2019s efforts to open the country.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that the deal, negotiated by his predecessor Barack Obama, was flawed because it is not permanent, does not address Iran\u2019s missile program and does not punish Iran for meddling in the affairs of other countries.\n\nTrump\u2019s hard line is backed by Israel and by Washington\u2019s Arab allies in the Gulf, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which see Iran as a foe and which gain leverage over global oil prices by keeping Iranian crude off the market.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted: \u201cAfter a year of patience, Iran stops measures that US has made impossible to continue.\u201d Zarif said the remaining countries had a \u201cnarrowing window\u201d to save the deal.", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-rouhani-idUSKCN1SE0I5", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": "2019-05-08 10:18:57+00:00"}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9985299542658265, "vector": [0.07399000391156019, 0.2362060987944878, 0.0, 5.0], "id": 70118}], "id": "83e33b59-b7f3-4666-8aaa-9ce9d44ab010", "title": "targets Iran's metals for sanctions, Tehran relaxes nuclear...", "text": "WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday imposed new sanctions on Iran, targeting revenue from its exports of industrial metals, the latest salvo in tensions between Washington and Tehran over a 2015 international accord curbing the Islamic Republic\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nIran had announced hours earlier that it was relaxing some restrictions on its nuclear program, steps that stopped short of violating the deal with world powers for now, but threatening more action if countries do not shield it from U.S. sanctions.\n\nAn executive order issued by Trump covers Iran\u2019s iron, steel, aluminum, and copper sectors, the government\u2019s largest non-petroleum-related sources of export revenue and 10 percent of its export economy, a White House statement said.\n\n\u201cTehran can expect further actions unless it fundamentally alters its conduct,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe administration says the nuclear deal, negotiated by Trump\u2019s predecessor Barack Obama, was flawed as it is not permanent, does not address Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and does not punish it for waging proxy wars in the Middle East.\n\nTensions between the two countries were already high when the Trump administration said last weekend that it was deploying a carrier strike group and bombers to the Middle East in response to what it said were \u201ctroubling indications and warnings\u201d from Iran.\n\nOn Wednesday, a senior administration official said the United States was \u201cnot escalating militarily against Iran\u201d and accused Iran of being \u201cprovocative.\u201d It was in Iran\u2019s best interests to continue complying with the pact, the official said.\n\nThe executive order effectively bans entities from the purchase, acquisition, sale, transport, or marketing of those minerals and their products from Iran or face sanctions.\n\nIt also says any individuals and entities would be subject to U.S. sanctions if they knowingly engaged in a significant transaction for the sale, supply, or transfer to Iran of significant goods or services used in connection with those industrial metal sectors.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury said it was allowing a 90-day winding down period for transactions related to Iran\u2019s metals sectors and warned against entering into any new business after May 8, saying that would not be considered a wind-down activity.\n\nA year ago, Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from the nuclear deal signed by Iran, Russia, China, Britain, France, Germany and the United States. The accord relaxed international sanctions on Iran in return for Tehran accepting curbs on its nuclear program that were designed to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons. Tehran has said it pursued a peaceful nuclear program only.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani announced changes on Wednesday that experts said seemed tailored to ensure Tehran avoids triggering the deal\u2019s mechanism to punish it for violations, at least for now. The main new measure that takes effect now would have limited practical impact: a halt to Iran\u2019s sales of enriched uranium and heavy water to other countries.\n\nThe deal allows such sales so Iran can keep reducing its stockpiles below maximum thresholds, but Washington already effectively barred the sales with a sanctions move last week. For now, Iran\u2019s stockpile of enriched uranium is still well below the deal\u2019s cap and heavy water is less sensitive.\n\n\u201cThe Iranian people and the world should know that today is not the end of the JCPOA,\u201d Rouhani said in a televised address, using the acronym for the nuclear deal. \u201cThese are actions in line with the JCPOA.\u201d\n\nRouhani also threatened that in 60 days Iran would resume enrichment of uranium beyond the low fissile purity - suitable for civilian nuclear power generation - allowed under the deal, unless the five other powers signed up to it found a way to protect Iran\u2019s oil and banking industries from U.S. sanctions.\n\nTehran halting compliance with some elements of the nuclear deal was \u201cnothing less than nuclear blackmail of Europe,\u201d Tim Morrison, special assistant to the U.S. president and senior director for weapons of mass destruction, told a conference.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for the community of nations to strongly condemn Iran\u2019s nuclear misconduct and increase pressure on the regime to comply with U.S. demands,\u201d Morrison said.\n\nMorrison said the United States would move quickly against any attempt by European countries to undermine Washington\u2019s sanctions pressure on Iran. He advised them against using the so-called Special Purpose Vehicle to facilitate non-dollar trade to circumvent U.S. sanctions.\n\nFrom this month, Washington has effectively ordered countries worldwide to stop buying Iranian oil or face sanctions of their own. The Trump administration has revoked waivers that had allowed some countries to continue buying Iranian oil and it aims to reduce Iranian crude exports to zero.\n\nWashington has also blacklisted Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group. Iran responded with threats to close the Gulf\u2019s Strait of Hormuz - the conduit for about a third of the world\u2019s seaborne oil exports - if its ships were blocked there.\n\n\u201cWe have made our focus diplomatic isolation and economic pressure and that policy is working,\u201d Brian Hook, Special Envoy for Iran, said in a briefing. Hook said that more nations now, compared with a year ago, were in agreement with the United States on Iran.\n\nWashington\u2019s European allies opposed Trump\u2019s decision to pull out and have tried, so far in vain, to find ways to blunt the economic impact of new U.S. sanctions, which include an all-out effort to block Iran\u2019s oil exports to throttle its economy.\n\nFrance and Germany both said they wanted to keep the nuclear deal alive, and warned Iran not to violate it.\n\n\u201cIt is important to avoid any action that would impede the implementation of their obligations by the parties now engaged in the accord or that would fuel an escalation,\u201d deputy foreign ministry spokesman Olivier Gauvin said in a statement.\n\nRussia and Iran both blamed the United States for what they portrayed as Tehran\u2019s forced decision to suspend some pledges under the nuclear deal, while putting the onus on European powers to guarantee sanctions relief for Iran.\n\nChina said the deal should continue to be implemented and called on all sides to exercise restraint and pursue dialogue.\n\nThe looming total ban on oil sales is likely to sharply increase the economic hardship for Iran\u2019s 80 million people.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif separately will write to the European Union, the agency said. Details of the letters will not be publicly disclosed, it said.\n\nThe letters will come as officials in the Islamic Republic previously warned that Iran might increase its uranium enrichment, potentially pulling away from a deal it has sought to salvage for months. Already, the White House has announced the deployment of a U.S. aircraft carrier and a bomber wing to the Persian Gulf over unspecified threats from Iran.\n\nThe United Nations' nuclear watchdog says Iran has continued to comply with the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw it limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. But American sanctions have wreaked havoc on Iran's already-anemic economy, while promised help from European partners in the deal haven't alleviated the pain.\n\nThe U.S. last week stopped issuing waivers for countries importing Iranian crude oil, a crucial source of cash for Iran's government. It also halted waivers allowing Iran to store excess heavy water in Oman and to swap enriched uranium for raw yellowcake with Russia.\n\nTrump campaigned on a promise to tear up the deal struck by his predecessor, Barack Obama. While Trump has sought to dismantle much of Obama's policies, he particularly criticized the Iran nuclear deal for failing to address Tehran's ballistic missile program and what he described as its malign influence across the rest of the Mideast.\n\nA statement Sunday night from U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said the USS Abraham Lincoln, other ships in the carrier's strike group and a bomber wing would deploy to the Mideast. Bolton blamed \"a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings,\" without elaborating.\n\n\"The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces,\" Bolton said.\n\nIran's hard-line Javan newspaper, associated with the Revolutionary Guard, said Wednesday would \"ignite the matchstick for burning the deal.\" It suggested in its Tuesday edition that Iran may install advanced centrifuges at its Natanz facility and begin enrichment at its Fordo facility, activities prohibited under the nuclear deal.\n\nThe USS Abraham Lincoln had been in the Mediterranean Sea conducting operations alongside the USS John C. Stennis, another aircraft carrier that has twice been in the Persian Gulf in recent months.\n\nHowever, American military officials have stopped the near-continuous presence of aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf, a pattern set following the 1991 Gulf War. American air bases spanning the region can scramble fighter jets and drones, lessening the necessity of an aircraft carrier as U.S. officials also worry about China and Russia.\n\nAlready in the Persian Gulf is a group of U.S. Navy warships led by the USS Kearsarge, an amphibious assault ship carrying troops from the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit. The Kearsarge also carries AV-8B Harrier fighter jets, MH-60 helicopters and MV-22 Osprey airplanes.\n\nAcross the wider 5th Fleet, there were 17 warships deployed, according to the most-recent count by the U.S. Naval Institute, which tracks deployments around the world.\n\nThe Bahrain-based 5th Fleet declined to comment on the White House announcement when reached by the AP on Monday.\n\nIt also remains unclear what bomber wing would be deployed to the region. Typically, the al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, home to the forward headquarters of the U.S. military's Central Command, hosts such bomber deployments.\n\nIn late March, the Air Force acknowledged a rare gap in bomber cover in the Mideast after a squadron of B-1 Lancers left al-Udeid to return to Texas. B-52 bombers also had been deployed to the area to keep up attacks on the Islamic State group, the first time the aging aircraft had deployed to the region in 25 years.\n\nOfficials at al-Udeid, which also hosts the F-35 fighter jet, declined to answer questions from the AP.\n\nThe Trump administration, which abruptly announced in December that it was pulling out of Syria, still maintains 2,000 U.S. troops in the northern part of the war-torn country. Officials suggest they serve as a check on Iranian ambitions and help ensure that Islamic State fighters do not regroup. No significant U.S. forces have so far withdrawn from Syria.\n\nTrump has also said he has no plans to withdraw the 5,200 troops stationed in Iraq as part of a security agreement to advise, assist and support the country's troops in the fight against IS. Earlier this year, Trump angered Iraqi politicians and Iranian-backed factions by saying troops should stay there to keep an eye on neighboring Iran.", "url": "https://www.uticaod.com/article/20190507/NEWS/190509558", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": "2019-05-07 19:01:43+00:00"}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9991445565104542, "vector": [0.03281625766348487, 0.21302192553436355, 0.0, 6.0], "id": 70118}], "id": "58e33697-449b-453a-a8b2-c76647e820f2", "title": "US sanctions to hit Iran's metals industry, a major employer", "text": "TEHRAN, Iran (AP) \u2014 U.S. sanctions have targeted Iran's government, its paramilitary forces and the oil exports that fund them.

The metals industry is a major employer and a rare bright spot for Iran's anemic economy.\n\nMany Iranians already feel the vise squeezing ever tighter around the country, which has caused its currency, the rial, to depreciate rapidly and push the price of nearly everything beyond the reach of ordinary consumers.\n\n\"I don't think (the U.S.) can, or wants to fight Iran ... because wars are no longer a thing,\" said Ahmad Hashemi, who sells steel products like sheet metal and beams in southern Tehran. \"Nowadays, wars are economic wars. Look at these sanctions. It's so easy.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump issued his executive order Wednesday announcing the sanctions. That came just after Iran threatened to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels in 60 days if European leaders fail to negotiate new terms of the nuclear deal to protect Iran's ability to trade on the global market.\n\nThe new sanctions are part of Trump's maximalist policy targeting Iran after he pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear deal a year ago. The United States, Germany, Britain, France, Russia, China and the European Union signed the deal in 2015, lifting international sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program.\n\nBut the Trump administration contends that the deal, reached under former President Barack Obama, should have included limits on Iran's ballistic missile program and curbed its regional influence. Supporters of the deal describe it as an important measure freezing Iran's nuclear program while offering a step toward further negotiations.\n\n\"We have imposed the toughest sanctions ever on this Iranian regime,\" said Brian Hook, a U.S. envoy for Iran. \"We have designated nearly 1,000 individuals and entities since the beginning of the administration. We have taken Iran's oil exports to historic lows. And we have stopped issuing oil waivers to those who import Iranian oil, which means zeroing out the purchases of Iranian crude.\"\n\nIran's domestic metal industry includes dozen of steel mills, mainly government-owned, that employ about 50,000 workers. Of the 25 million tons of steel produced, Iran exports over 30%, earning nearly $4 billion yearly. Its top markets have been Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq and Indonesia, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.\n\nAbout 3,000 factories and workshops produce goods for Iran's domestic market ranging from kitchen utensils and building frames to offshore oil rigs and military vehicles. It also feeds into Iran's domestic car manufacturing plants.\n\nMetal-related industries employ about 10 percent of the country's 22 million workers, a report by Iran's parliament said. How the sanctions will affect Iran's miners remains unclear. About 6 percent of its 8,840 mines produce raw materials such as iron, copper and aluminum.\n\nTehran-based economic analyst Gholamreza Kiamenhr said he believed that the sanctions on the metals industry \"possibly affects employment and production lines,\" although it won't be as crippling as those on Iran's oil industry.\n\nEsfandyar Batmanghelidj, the founder of the Iranian economic website Bourse & Bazaar, said the measures appear aimed at stoking further unrest in the country. At the end of 2017 through the start of 2018, economic protests swept across 75 cities and towns, lasting for days and resulting in the deaths of dozens of people and the arrest of hundreds more.\n\nSome demonstrations have already hit steel mills. In December, authorities detained an unspecified number of steelworkers after five weeks of protests over delays in paying salaries.\n\n\"Creating the conditions for mass unemployment \u2014 especially among the blue collar workers employed by state-owned enterprises who form the backbone of Iran's economy \u2014 is the likely aim of the Trump administration's latest round of sanctions,\" Batmanghelidj wrote.\n\nIt's also weakening the position of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the relatively moderate cleric whose signature accomplishment was the nuclear deal.\n\n\"The president should bravely admit the obvious defeat of his recent six years of strategies and resign,\" said Abdolreza Davari, a close adviser to former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a hard-liner. \"This will quickly prepare the ground for taking office by a new government that is capable to control the country in this current critical situation.\"\n\nAfter the U.S. withdrew from the nuclear accord, it restored the crippling sanctions, exacerbating Iran's economic crisis. The rial, which traded at 32,000 to $1 at the time of the accord, traded Thursday at 156,500, creeping further downward.\n\n\"Even before the latest sanctions, the previous ones already impacted our daily lives and have been effective,\" said a 52-year-old engineer who gave his name as Afshin. \"If we say they had no effect we are deceiving ourselves. I can say that my family has gone from a middle-class family to a lower-class family. The situation is much worse than before.\"\n\nMany believe the situation will only get worse as time goes on. Many of those who are young and unmarried discuss fleeing the country with friends. Those who are older simply shrug and watch as prices of everything from meat to medicines climb out of reach.\n\n\"We made a mistake when we shut down our nuclear program. As an Iranian, I say that was a mistake. If we start again and they impose sanctions, then we can at least say we are under sanctions for the nuclear program,\" said Hashemi, the steel products merchant. \"Now we are wondering why we are under sanctions.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was to meet Wednesday in Moscow with his Russian counterpart.\n\n\"If the five countries join negotiations and help Iran to reach its benefits in the field of oil and banking, Iran will return to its commitments according to the nuclear deal,\" Rouhani said.\n\nHowever, Rouhani warned of a \"strong reaction\" if European leaders instead sought to impose more sanctions on Iran via the U.N. Security Council. He did not elaborate.\n\nZarif separately issued his own warning from Moscow.\n\n\"After a year of patience, Iran stops measures that (the) US has made impossible to continue,\" he wrote on Twitter. World powers have \"a narrowing window to reverse this.\"\n\nRouhani also said that if the 60 days pass without action, Iran will halt a Chinese-led effort to redesign its Arak heavy water nuclear reactor. Such reactors produce plutonium that can be used in nuclear weapons.\n\nThere was no immediate response from the U.S. However, the White House said Sunday it would dispatch an aircraft carrier and a bomber wing to the Persian Gulf over what it described as a new threat from Iran.\n\nIran reached the deal with world powers in 2015. Western governments had long feared Iran's atomic program could allow it to build nuclear weapons. Iran has always maintained its program is for peaceful purposes.\n\nUnder terms of the deal, Iran can keep a stockpile of no more than 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of low-enriched uranium. That's compared to the 10,000 kilograms (22,046 pounds) of higher-enriched uranium it once had.\n\nThe U.S. last week ended deals allowing Iran to exchange its enriched uranium for unrefined yellowcake uranium with Russia, as well as it being able to sell its heavy water to Oman.

He set a 60-day deadline for new terms to the nuclear accord, after which Tehran would resume higher uranium enrichment.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to negotiate, within the boundaries of JCPOA,\u201d he said referring to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal. \u201cIt is not us who has left the negotiation table.\u201d\n\nIn November, the United States reimposed sanctions that have strangled Iran\u2019s oil and banking sectors as well as its foreign trade. The sanctions came after the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withdraw from the pact that Iran negotiated with world powers in 2015 and that curbed its nuclear program in exchange for widespread sanctions relief.\n\nRouhani\u2019s speech coincided with the first anniversary of the U.S. withdrawal and came amid heightened American economic and military pressure on Iran, including the deployment of an aircraft carrier to the Middle East \u2013 a move that U.S. officials say was in response to credible indications that Tehran planned to attack U.S. interests in the region.\n\nIn his speech, Rouhani stressed that Iran\u2019s new posture towards the nuclear accord is intended to spur negotiations rather than confrontation and that Tehran was is growing impatient with upholding its commitment to a deal that has provided little of its promised economic and political benefit.\n\n\u201cWe will not start breaching commitments and waging any war,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will not give in to bullying either.\u201d\n\nIran had been complying fully with the terms of the deal even after the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew last year, according to the United Nation\u2019s Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nThe measures announced by Rouhani came after speculation that Iran would take a more provocative approach, including fully exiting the accord or moving immediately to higher uranium enrichment. It was unclear whether the less dramatic moves it adopted would prevent a further unraveling of the deal or forestall additional punitive measures by allies or adversaries.\n\nUnderscoring the significance of Iran\u2019s move, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif traveled to Moscow and delivered a personal letter on Wednesday from Rouhani to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Tehran\u2019s closest international ally.\n\nRouhani praised Moscow \u2013 also a signatory to the JCPOA \u2013 as a friend of Iran but said other participants in the deal have \u201cfailed to fulfill their obligations.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, we\u2019ve been patient for a year,\u201d Zarif told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, according to a Russian translation of Zarif\u2019s remarks.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that Putin saw \u201cno alternative\u201d to the Iran nuclear deal, Russian news agencies reported. Peskov said the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cpoorly conceived, reckless decisions\u201d have led Iran to curtail its commitments.\n\n\u201cRussian diplomats will certainly continue to discuss this issue, including with European partners, in order to achieve the long-term sustainability\u201d of the Iran deal, Peskov said.\n\nFrench officials, however, warned that Iran risks further isolation from Wednesday\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cToday, nothing would be worse than Iran, itself, leaving this accord,\u201d French Defense Minister Florence Parly told France\u2019s BFMTV on Wednesday.\n\nAsked whether Iran could face sanctions as a result of its decision, Parly said: \u201cProbably. That will be one of the things that will be examined.\u201d\n\nBut she said that Europe remains committed to supporting the agreement. Europe \u201cwants to be able to continue to keep this agreement alive,\u201d she said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been staunchly opposed to the Iranian nuclear deal since from the outset and credits his own lobbying for triggering the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal, referred to Rouhani\u2019s announcement during a ceremony to on Wednesday to mark Israel Memorial Day.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will continue to fight those who seek our souls, and we will deepen our roots even further into the homeland.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s security establishment has been more mixed in its assessment of the advantages of retaining a deal and is concerned that Iran will now accelerate its nuclear program in the near future, Israel\u2019s Army Radio reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe military believes that in the wake of U.S. sanctions and international pressure on Iran, Tehran will be more assertive in the region, and Israel is \u201cbraced\u201d for Iranian aggression, the station said.\n\nThe Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIran\u2019s decision comes amid relentless targeting of its economic and military sectors by the White House.\n\nThe United States has imposed sanctions on purchasers of Iranian oil and designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a branch of the Iranian military, as a terrorist group. On Friday, the State Department announced new restrictions on Iran\u2019s civil nuclear program, despite protests by European allies.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from the White House to the Iranian announcement. Rouhani sent a letter notifying the signatories to the nuclear deal of Iran\u2019s reduced commitments on Wednesday, according to IRNA, the official state news agency of Iran the official Islamic Republic News Agency.\n\nThe original signatories apart from the United States \u2013 Britain, France, Germany and the European Union, in addition to Russia and China \u2013 have continued to support the nuclear accord and have been unable to hinder the White House\u2019s determination to isolate Iran.\n\nIn recent weeks, Iranian officials have indicated that the country could begin enriching uranium levels beyond what is permitted by the nuclear accord or limit access to the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s monitors.\n\nUranium fuel used as fuel in power plants only needs to be enriched only to a low level. However, when it is enriched to much higher levels, it can be used to produce as fissile material in nuclear weapons. Iran has not produced weapons-grade enriched uranium.\n\nUltimately, though, \u201cthe Iranians certainly tried to find the mildest first step here, which would both pressure the Europeans and appease their domestic constituents without provoking a strong reaction from the U.S. and angering the Russians too much,\u201d Ariane Tabatabai, an associate political scientist at the RAND Corporation Rand Corp., said in a text message.\n\n\u201cIran says it\u2019ll stop adhering to the stockpile limits in the deal, but in practice, it may not actually go above those limits \u2013 that remains to be seen,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re making the decision now to stop adhering to the limit and tomorrow they\u2019ll go above it. It\u2019ll take time and may or may not happen within the time frame they\u2019ve fixed for themselves.\u201d\n\nIran was also hoping to spur European allies to take a more \u201cproactive\u201d role in sustaining the nuclear accord and stand up to the United States, she said.\n\n\u201cThe Iranians actually don\u2019t want the JCPOA to collapse, and they don\u2019t want to have to take the next steps they\u2019ve laid out because they know it can torpedo the deal.\u201d\n\nFahim reported from Istanbul.

Meanwhile, a U.S. campaign of sanctions hammering Iran's anemic economy and blocking its sale of oil on the global market is only making life worse, putting further pressure on both its Shiite theocracy and its 80 million people.\n\nRouhani himself compared the situation to a medical emergency for the Islamic Republic, only 40 years after its founding.\n\n\"We felt that the nuclear deal needs a surgery, and the painkiller pills of the last year have been ineffective,\" Rouhani said. \"This surgery is for saving the deal, not destroying it.\"\n\nIran on Wednesday stopped its sale of excess uranium and heavy water as a first step, Rouhani said, something required under the deal. The U.S. last week ended deals allowing Iran to exchange its enriched uranium for unrefined yellowcake uranium with Russia, and to sell its heavy water, which is used as a coolant in nuclear reactors, to Oman.\n\nIn 60 days, if no new deal is in place, Iran will increase its enrichment of uranium beyond the accord-permitted 3.67%, which can fuel a commercial nuclear power plant. Rouhani did not say how far Iran would be willing to enrich, although the head of its nuclear program again reiterated Iran could reach 20% enrichment within four days.\n\nOnce a country enriches uranium to around 20%, scientists say the time needed to reach the 90% threshold for weapons-grade uranium is halved. Iran long has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. However, Iranian state television's English-language service Press TV, citing sources close to presidency, said the country would withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty if Europeans sought to sanction Iran at the U.N. Security Council.\n\nRouhani also said that if the 60 days pass without action, Iran will halt a Chinese-led effort to redesign its Arak heavy water nuclear reactor.

World powers have \"a narrowing window to reverse this.\"\n\nReaction came swiftly from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a staunch critic of Iran and the nuclear deal.\n\n\"I heard that Iran intends to continue its nuclear program. We will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons,\" Netanyahu said. \"We will continue to fight those who seek to take our lives, and we will thrust our roots even deeper into the soil of our homeland.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in London, said America \"will wait and observe\" what Iran does next.\n\n\"They have made have made a number of statements about actions they have threatened to do in order to get the world to jump,\" Pompeo said.\n\nRouhani also made an implicit threat as well to Europe, saying Iran now cooperates on issues like targeting Afghan opium and hashish traffickers and controlling immigration.\n\n\"You are obliged ... for your own security, for protecting your youths against drugs as well as controlling influx of immigrants,\" the president said.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called Iran's threat to resume higher enrichment of uranium an \"unwelcome step.\" French Defense Secretary Florence Parly was much more dire. \"Nothing would be worse than Iran leaving this deal,\" he told BMFTV.\n\nIran's move comes at a sensitive moment in the wider Middle East. The White House said it dispatched the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf over what it described as a new threat from Iran. Israel, which has conducted pre-emptive bombings of nuclear facilities in Iraq and Syria, has vowed to never allow Iran to obtain an atomic weapon.\n\nApparently responding to that, the general staff of Iran's armed forces issued a statement applauding Rouhani's decision and warning its enemies.\n\n\"Any possible movement by them will face a regrettable response by Iranian nation and its armed forces,\" the statement said, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.\n\nThe 2015 deal lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program. It reached the deal after years of negotiations, including secret talks in Oman between Iran and the administration of former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe U.S. withdrew from the deal under Trump, whose administration contends the accord should have limited Iran's ballistic missile program and what it describes as Tehran's malign regional influence.\n\nHowever, the U.N.'s atomic watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, repeatedly has verified that Iran stuck to terms of the deal. The agency did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nAfter the U.S. withdrew from the accord, it restored the crippling sanctions, exacerbating a severe economic crisis. The Iranian rial, which traded at 32,000 to $1 at the time of the accord, traded Wednesday at 153,500.\n\nThat Iran chose to keep its excess uranium and heavy water first, rather than abandon the accord in its entirety, shows it still hopes to secure a deal. In years of negotiations over its nuclear program, Iran similarly has gone step-by-step in ramping its activities while holding talks. It also protects Rouhani, a relative moderate cleric within Iran's Shiite theocracy, from criticism by hard-liners who long maintained Iran gave up too much in the nuclear deal.", "url": "https://www.abc10.com/article/news/nation-world/iran-threatens-more-uranium-enrichment-if-no-new-nuke-deal/507-2d3a5191-0181-4296-9caa-cb532cc28b12", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": null}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9999607767947791, "vector": [0.12570486966365932, 0.35412722346873254, 0.0, 6.0], "id": 70118}], "id": "2f7ffd94-1f26-446b-aa60-8036e4709a63", "title": "Iran threatens uranium enrichment if world powers do not keep...", "text": "LONDON, May 8 (Reuters) -

The United States withdrew from the deal a year ago and re-imposed its sanctions.\n\nThe deal's restrictions were aimed at extending the time Iran would need to produce a nuclear bomb, if it chose to, to a year from roughly two to three months. The United States and the U.N. nuclear watchdog believe Iran had a nuclear weapons programme that it abandoned. Tehran denies ever having had one.\n\nBelow are some of the key restrictions imposed by the nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n\nThe biggest obstacle to producing nuclear weapons is obtaining enough fissile material - weapons-grade highly enriched uranium or plutonium - for the bomb's core.\n\nThe deal caps the level of purity to which Iran can enrich uranium hexafluoride, the feedstock for centrifuges, at 3.67 percent, far below the 90 percent of weapons grade. It is also well below the 20 percent level to which Iran enriched uranium before the deal. The 3.67 percent cap lasts 15 years.\n\nIran has two vast enrichment sites, at Natanz and Fordow. Much of Natanz is deep underground and Fordow is buried inside a mountain, which is widely believed to protect them from aerial bombardment.\n\nThe deal allows Iran to continue enrichment at Natanz but with constraints. It turns Fordow into a \"nuclear, physics and technology centre\" where centrifuges are used for purposes other than enrichment, like producing stable isotopes.\n\n- Slashes the number of centrifuges installed in Iran to roughly 6,000 from around 19,000 before the deal\n\n- Only allows Iran to produce enriched uranium with its first-generation IR-1 centrifuges\n\n- Allows Iran to use small numbers of more advanced centrifuges for research, but without accumulating enriched uranium, for 10 years\n\nCaps Iran's stock of low-enriched uranium at 300 kg of uranium hexafluoride enriched to 3.67 percent or its equivalent for 15 years.\n\nIt produced tonnes before the deal, and any excess enriched uranium was either downblended to the level of natural uranium or shipped out of the country in exchange for natural uranium.\n\nThe United States said in 2015 that the deal reduced Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium by 98 percent, to less than the amount needed for one weapon from enough for about 10 previously.\n\nIran was further away from being able to produce a weapon with plutonium than with uranium. It was building a heavy-water reactor at Arak that could eventually have produced spent fuel from which plutonium could be separated.\n\n- The core of that reactor has been removed and filled with concrete to make it unusable\n\n- The reactor is being redesigned so as to \"minimise the production of plutonium and not to produce weapon-grade plutonium in normal operation\"\n\n- All spent fuel from Arak will be shipped out of Iran, for the reactor's lifetime.\n\n- Iran commits not to engage in reprocessing or reprocessing research activities for 15 years.\n\n- Iran can continue to produce heavy water, used as a moderator in reactors like Arak, but its stock is capped around 130 tonnes. It has previously shipped excess amounts out of the country for storage or sold them. This restriction lasts 15 years.\n\n- Requires Iran to provisionally apply the International Atomic Energy Agency's Additional Protocol - which grants the agency wide-ranging inspection powers - and \"subsequently seek ratification and entry into force\".\n\n- Grants U.N. nuclear inspectors daily access to Natanz and Fordow for 15 years.\n\n- Says the deal's signatories must vet Iran's purchases of nuclear or dual-use equipment.\n\n- Bans Iran from carrying out a range of activities that could contribute to making a nuclear bomb, such as computer simulations of a nuclear explosion or designing certain multi-point detonation systems. In some cases, those activities can be carried out with the other signatories' approval.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/factbox--iran-s-commitments-under-its-nuclear-deal-11514684", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": "2019-05-08 19:38:48+00:00"}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9910179667276579, "vector": [0.0302019324156183, 0.11270083789400503, 1.0, 5.0], "id": 70118}, {"probability": 0.97224135384834, "vector": [0.1932931632563931, 0.21727232275591732, 0.0, 2.0], "id": 70107}], "id": "a41758e7-d4cf-4416-b3fa-bf136727cd17", "title": "No time to go 'wobbly': Pompeo scolds Britain over China and Huawei", "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Britain on Wednesday it needed to change its attitude towards China and telecoms company Huawei, casting the world\u2019s second largest economy as a threat to the West similar to that once posed by the Soviet Union.\n\nPompeo questioned the attitude of Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s government towards Beijing and goaded London by saying that the late former British leader Margaret Thatcher, who was known as the Iron Lady, would have taken a much firmer line with China.\n\nHe brought a tough message to Britain, which agreed last month to allow China\u2019s Huawei Technologies a restricted role in building parts of its 5G network.\n\n\u201cNow is not the time for either of us to go wobbly,\u201d Pompeo said in a speech of the so-called special relationship, paraphrasing what Thatcher once famously told late U.S. President George H.W.

Despite efforts so far by the others to keep the deal from collapsing, Iran\u2019s economy has been struggling and its currency has plummeted in value after the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions.\n\nLater Wednesday, Trump issued an executive order announcing new sanctions targeting Iran\u2019s steel, aluminum, copper and iron sectors, which provide foreign currency earnings for Tehran.\n\nMany international corporations are reluctant to risk running afoul of Washington and have severed ties with Iran; a complicated barter-type system set up by the Europeans to allow their businesses to skirt direct financial transactions with Iran \u2014 and thus evade possible U.S. sanctions \u2014 is not yet finalized.\n\nIran has continued abiding by the stipulations of the deal, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, but had been expressing increasing frustration with the inability of the Europeans to provide economic relief, culminating with Wednesday\u2019s threat to resume higher enrichment of uranium in 60 days unless new terms are negotiated.\n\nDespite Rouhani\u2019s threatening rhetoric and the now-ticking clock, Europeans were cautiously hoping the Iranian president was not on the verge of breaking the deal but instead seeking to show strength domestically as the economy slumps.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said his office had been in contact with all the others involved in the Iran deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, since the announcement to see what could be done to get Tehran to back down.\n\n\u201cOur opinion is and remains: We want to preserve the agreement, in particular to prevent Iran from coming into possession of nuclear weapons,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe don\u2019t need further escalation in the region.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, French Defense Minister Florence Parly told BFMTV television that \u201cnothing would be worse than Iran leaving this deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe absolutely want to keep this agreement alive,\u201d Parly said.\n\nAt a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in London, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called Iran\u2019s threat \u201cunwelcome\u201d and urged it not to take \u201cfurther escalatory steps,\u201d while emphasizing Britain was not ready to give up on the JCPOA.\n\n\u201cFor as long as Iran keeps its commitments then so, too, will the United Kingdom,\u201d he said.\n\nHunt said Britain and the U.S. agreed on the need to confront the threat from Iran, but \u201cit\u2019s no secret we have a different approach on how best to achieve that.\u201d\n\nPompeo was restrained in his own assessment of the letter that Iran sent to the JCPOA group outlining its intentions.\n\n\u201cI think it was intentionally ambiguous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait to see what Iran\u2019s actions actually are. They have made have made a number of statements about actions they have threatened to do in order to get the world to jump.\u201d\n\nIn his television address, Rouhani also tried a gambit designed to hit a sore spot for Europe, over the issue of migration and drug-smuggling.\n\nNoting that Iran now cooperates on issues like controlling immigration and targeting Afghan opium and hashish traffickers, he said: \u201cYou are obliged ... for your own security, for protecting your youths against drugs as well as controlling influx of immigrants.\u201d\n\nThere was no immediate response from officials in Europe, which has seen an influx of refugees and migrants from the Middle East in recent years.\n\nChina, a key Iranian ally and trading partner, suggested that Washington\u2019s recent decision to deploy an aircraft carrier group and a bomber wing to the Middle East to confront unspecified threats from Tehran had added fuel to the fire.\n\n\u201cWe regret that the U.S. has further aggravated the tension on the Iranian nuclear issue,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. \u201cWe call on all parties concerned to exercise restraint, strengthen dialogue and avoid escalating tensions.\u201d\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov went a step further, saying the situation surrounding the fate of the 2015 nuclear accord has been complicated by \u201cirresponsible behavior\u201d from Washington.\n\nAfter meeting in Moscow with his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif, Lavrov reaffirmed Russia\u2019s support for the deal and blamed the U.S. for undermining it.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is to blame for the situation and it makes it difficult for both Iran to fulfill its obligations and ... for the general state of the nuclear non-proliferation regime,\u201d Lavrov said.\n\nZarif insisted that Iran\u2019s decision to partially withdraw from certain provisions did not violate the agreement, and asserted it was provoked by U.S. actions toward Iran.\n\nHe also said Iran will uphold its obligations if European signatories to the deal uphold theirs.\n\nAssociated Press writers Matthew Lee and Jill Lawless in London, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Elaine Ganley in Paris, Lorne Cook in Brussels and Matthew Bodner in Moscow contributed.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif separately will write to the European Union, the agency said.\n\nThe semi-official ISNA news agency reported late Tuesday that Zarif had left for Moscow to meet with Russian leader Vladimir Putin to discuss bilateral and international issues, without elaborating.\n\nDetails of the letters, all to signers of the 2015 accord, will not be publicly disclosed, it said.\n\nThe letters will come as officials in the Islamic Republic previously warned that Iran might increase its uranium enrichment, potentially pulling away from a deal it has sought to salvage for months.\n\nAlready, the White House has announced the deployment of a U.S. aircraft carrier and a bomber wing to the Persian Gulf because of potential threats from Iran. A U.S. official in Washington said Tuesday the intelligence information which prompted that move included indications Iran had put short-range ballistic missiles aboard boats in or near the Persian Gulf. The official agreed to discuss the sensitive situation only on condition of not being quoted by name.\n\nRELATED: Aircraft carrier deployed after indications Iran planned attack on US forces\n\nRELATED: Trump vetoes measure to end US support of Saudi war in Yemen\n\nThe United Nations' nuclear watchdog says Iran has continued to comply with the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw it limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. But American sanctions have wreaked havoc on Iran's already-anemic economy, while promised help from European partners in the deal haven't alleviated the pain.\n\nThe U.S. last week stopped issuing waivers for countries importing Iranian crude oil, a crucial source of cash for Iran's government. It also halted waivers allowing Iran to store excess heavy water in Oman and to swap enriched uranium for raw yellowcake with Russia.\n\nTrump campaigned on a promise to tear up the deal struck by his predecessor, Barack Obama. While Trump has sought to dismantle much of Obama's policies, he particularly criticized the Iran nuclear deal for failing to address Tehran's ballistic missile program and what he described as its malign influence across the rest of the Mideast.\n\nA statement Sunday night from U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said the USS Abraham Lincoln, other ships in the carrier's strike group and a bomber wing would deploy to the Mideast. Bolton blamed \"a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings,\" without elaborating.\n\n\"The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces,\" Bolton said.\n\nIran's hard-line Javan newspaper, associated with the Revolutionary Guard, said Wednesday would \"ignite the matchstick for burning the deal.\" It suggested in its Tuesday edition that Iran may install advanced centrifuges at its Natanz facility and begin enrichment at its Fordo facility, activities prohibited under the nuclear deal.\n\nThe USS Abraham Lincoln had been in the Mediterranean Sea conducting operations alongside the USS John C. Stennis, another aircraft carrier that has twice been in the Persian Gulf in recent months. On Tuesday, U.S. military officials said the Lincoln would be skipping a planned port call in Croatia to more rapidly reach the Persian Gulf.\n\nHowever, American military officials have stopped the near-continuous presence of aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf, a pattern set following the 1991 Gulf War. American air bases spanning the region can scramble fighter jets and drones, lessening the necessity of an aircraft carrier as U.S. officials also worry about China and Russia.\n\nAlready in the Persian Gulf is a group of U.S. Navy warships led by the USS Kearsarge, an amphibious assault ship carrying troops from the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit. The Kearsarge also carries AV-8B Harrier fighter jets, MH-60 helicopters and MV-22 Osprey airplanes.\n\nAcross the wider 5th Fleet, there were 17 warships deployed, according to the most-recent count by the U.S. Naval Institute, which tracks deployments around the world.\n\nThe Bahrain-based 5th Fleet declined to comment on the White House announcement when reached by the AP on Monday.\n\nIt also remains unclear where the bomber wing would be deployed to the region. Typically, the al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, home to the forward headquarters of the U.S. military's Central Command, hosts such bomber deployments.\n\nIn late March, the Air Force acknowledged a rare gap in bomber cover in the Mideast after a squadron of B-1 Lancers left al-Udeid to return to Texas. B-52 bombers also had been deployed to the area to keep up attacks on the Islamic State group, the first time the aging aircraft had deployed to the region in 25 years.\n\nOfficials at al-Udeid, which also hosts the F-35 fighter jet, declined to answer questions from the AP. However, a statement Tuesday from Central Command said the Air Force again planned to deploy B-52s to the region.\n\nThe Trump administration, which abruptly announced in December that it was pulling out of Syria, still maintains 2,000 U.S. troops in the northern part of the war-torn country. Officials suggest they serve as a check on Iranian ambitions and help ensure that Islamic State fighters do not regroup. No significant U.S. forces have so far withdrawn from Syria.\n\nTrump has also said he has no plans to withdraw the 5,200 troops stationed in Iraq as part of a security agreement to advise, assist and support the country's troops in the fight against IS. Earlier this year, Trump angered Iraqi politicians and Iranian-backed factions by saying troops should stay there to keep an eye on neighboring Iran.\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

But American sanctions have wreaked havoc on Iran's already-anemic economy, while promised help from European partners in the deal haven't alleviated the pain.\n\nThe U.S. last week stopped issuing waivers for countries importing Iranian crude oil, a crucial source of cash for Iran's government. It also halted waivers allowing Iran to store excess heavy water in Oman and to swap enriched uranium for raw yellowcake with Russia.\n\nTrump campaigned on a promise to tear up the deal struck by his predecessor, Barack Obama. While Trump has sought to dismantle much of Obama's policies, he particularly criticized the Iran nuclear deal for failing to address Tehran's ballistic missile program and what he described as its malign influence across the rest of the Mideast.\n\nA statement Sunday night from U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said the USS Abraham Lincoln, other ships in the carrier's strike group and a bomber wing would deploy to the Mideast. Bolton blamed \"a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings,\" without elaborating.\n\n\"The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces,\" Bolton said.\n\nIran's hard-line Javan newspaper, associated with the Revolutionary Guard, said Wednesday would \"ignite the matchstick for burning the deal.\" It suggested in its Tuesday edition that Iran may install advanced centrifuges at its Natanz facility and begin enrichment at its Fordo facility, activities prohibited under the nuclear deal.\n\nThe USS Abraham Lincoln had been in the Mediterranean Sea conducting operations alongside the USS John C. Stennis, another aircraft carrier that has twice been in the Persian Gulf in recent months. On Tuesday, U.S. military officials said the Lincoln would be skipping a planned port call in Croatia to more rapidly reach the Persian Gulf.\n\nHowever, American military officials have stopped the near-continuous presence of aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf, a pattern set following the 1991 Gulf War. American air bases spanning the region can scramble fighter jets and drones, lessening the necessity of an aircraft carrier as U.S. officials also worry about China and Russia.\n\nAlready in the Persian Gulf is a group of U.S. Navy warships led by the USS Kearsarge, an amphibious assault ship carrying troops from the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit. The Kearsarge also carries AV-8B Harrier fighter jets, MH-60 helicopters and MV-22 Osprey airplanes.\n\nAcross the wider 5th Fleet, there were 17 warships deployed, according to the most-recent count by the U.S. Naval Institute, which tracks deployments around the world.\n\nThe Bahrain-based 5th Fleet declined to comment on the White House announcement when reached by the AP on Monday.\n\nIt also remains unclear where the bomber wing would be deployed to the region. Typically, the al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, home to the forward headquarters of the U.S. military's Central Command, hosts such bomber deployments.\n\nIn late March, the Air Force acknowledged a rare gap in bomber cover in the Mideast after a squadron of B-1 Lancers left al-Udeid to return to Texas. B-52 bombers also had been deployed to the area to keep up attacks on the Islamic State group, the first time the aging aircraft had deployed to the region in 25 years.\n\nOfficials at al-Udeid, which also hosts the F-35 fighter jet, declined to answer questions from the AP. However, a statement Tuesday from Central Command said the Air Force again planned to deploy B-52s to the region.\n\nThe Trump administration, which abruptly announced in December that it was pulling out of Syria, still maintains 2,000 U.S. troops in the northern part of the war-torn country. Officials suggest they serve as a check on Iranian ambitions and help ensure that Islamic State fighters do not regroup. No significant U.S. forces have so far withdrawn from Syria.\n\nTrump has also said he has no plans to withdraw the 5,200 troops stationed in Iraq as part of a security agreement to advise, assist and support the country's troops in the fight against IS. Earlier this year, Trump angered Iraqi politicians and Iranian-backed factions by saying troops should stay there to keep an eye on neighboring Iran.\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

It follows the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign of diplomatic and economic measures that have exacted a punishing toll on the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe effort has been a success in the view of the president and senior officials of his administration.\n\n\u201cBecause of our action, the Iranian regime is struggling to fund its campaign of violent terror, as its economy heads into an unprecedented depression, government revenue dries up, and inflation spirals out of control,\u201d Trump said Wednesday as he announced yet another round of sanctions, this time targeting the country\u2019s metals industry.\n\nTRENDING: Medical Expert from Canada Explains Why Elderly Will Suffer Most Under \u2018Medicare for All\u2019\n\nThe test is whether Iran will return to the bargaining table and agree to the new terms set by the Trump administration. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher, as shown by the U.S. decision over the weekend to rush an aircraft carrier group and other military assets to the Middle East to confront an unspecified Iranian threat.\n\nDemocrats used Iran\u2019s announcement as an opportunity to criticize Trump for withdrawing from the deal. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., called it a sign of \u201cblind, meandering, escalatory\u201d foreign policy.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s moves to restart their nuclear program are a direct consequence of the Trump administration withdrawing from the Iran deal,\u201d said Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nDespite Iran\u2019s announced deadline to pull out of the remainder of the nuclear deal, there have been signs that Tehran is willing to talk. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said during a visit to New York last month that he thinks Trump wants to deal but is trying an antagonistic approach at the direction of senior aides and Middle Eastern allies.\n\n\u201cTry the language of respect,\u201d he urged him, pretending to address the president directly. \u201cIt won\u2019t kill you, believe me.\u201d\n\nTrump himself says he\u2019s ready to talk. \u201cWe call on the regime to abandon its nuclear ambitions, change its destructive behavior, respect the rights of its people and return in good faith to the negotiating table,\u201d he said in announcing the new sanctions.\n\nBrian Hook, U.S. envoy to Iran, told reporters at the State Department that the U.S. laid out 12 demands last year for a new Iran deal and an end to the Trump administration\u2019s maximum pressure campaign. They include an end to all uranium enrichment, ceasing all support for militant groups in the Middle East and the release of all U.S. citizens detained in Iran on what the administration considers illegitimate grounds.\n\nThe United States, Germany, Britain, France, Russia, China and the European Union signed the 2015 deal with Iran, which lifted international sanctions in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, including restricting uranium enrichment for 10 years.\n\nOn May 8, 2018, Trump pulled out of the agreement, which he called \u201cthe worst deal in history.\u201d He said the accord should also have restrained Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and curbed Tehran\u2019s malign activities in the region and support for terror networks. The administration then re-imposed the sanctions on Iran that had been lifted when the agreement went into force.\n\nThe administration sees its move as a success.\n\nDeprived of much of its oil revenue, Iran cut its overall military spending by 28% after reaching a peak in 2017, Hook said. Inflation has risen in the Islamic Republic and the economy is in recession, forecast to shrink by 3%, while global oil prices haven\u2019t budged even as Iranian crude has been largely taken out of the market, production at a historic low.\n\n\u201cWe have made our focus around diplomatic isolation and economic pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cThat policy is working.\u201d\n\nThe other nations who signed the nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration have remained in the pact and have tried to provide Iran with enough economic incentives to keep the agreement alive.\n\nComplaining that it has not reaped the economic benefits it expected from signing the deal, Iran on Wednesday threatened to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels in 60 days if world powers fail to negotiate new terms. Iran stopped its sale of excess uranium and heavy water as a first step \u2014 something required under the deal. In 60 days, if no new deal is in place, Iran said it would increase its enrichment of uranium beyond 3.67%, which is permitted by the accord.\n\n\u201cZarif today is doing what Zarif does very well, which is setting the table for negotiations because I think the Iranians are now realizing that they may not be able to wait Trump out,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a critic of the deal.\n\n\u201cThe economy is in such bad shape and getting worse that they may experience a massive economic crisis before January 2021,\u201d when either Trump starts a second term or a new American president takes office. \u201cI think Zarif can\u2019t wait to get back to the table,\u201d Dubowitz said.\n\nThe heightened tension over Iran\u2019s nuclear program comes just after the U.S. dispatched the USS Lincoln aircraft carrier and bombers to the Persian Gulf in response to intelligence reports warning Iran was going to strike U.S. assets, interests or allies.\n\nGen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a Senate appropriations subcommittee Wednesday that intelligence threats the U.S. began receiving last week \u201creally intensified\u201d by the end of the week. He said the U.S. \u201csent some messages\u201d to Tehran, but did not provide any details.\n\nTraveling in London, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a restrained response to Iran\u2019s announcement. He said America \u201cwill wait and observe\u201d what Iran does next. \u201cThey have made a number of statements about actions they have threatened to do in order to get the world to jump,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nTim Morrison, senior director for weapons of mass destruction under national security adviser John Bolton at the White House, was more critical of Iran\u2019s threat to violate the nuclear deal. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is nothing less than nuclear blackmail.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press writer Lolita C.

This was known even before the investigation's conclusion, as President Barack Obama placed sanctions on Russia and ejected 35 Russian diplomats from the country. The administration accused them of acting as intelligence officers as opposed to being legitimate diplomats. A report by CNN indicates the Obama administration just prior to issuing the sanctions approached bipartisan congressional leaders about sending letters to the governor of each state to recommend shoring up web securities to defend election infrastructure. The administration was chastised by Republican leaders, who stated the request was partisan.There is now evidence that Russian sources hacked into a number of state election computer and server systems; however it is not known what was impacted.\n\nPresident Trump has taken to Twitter to indicate President Obama \"did nothing\" to prevent election interference. In fact, it is on record Obama told Putin on a number of occasions to cease interference with U.S. election. In January of this year -- with little attention by the mainstream media or any announcement by his office -- President Trump lifted a number of sanctions imposed by Obama against Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Deripaska has interest in a number of Russian companies, as well as being a personal friend of Putin and an associate of President Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort. Manafort pleaded guilty in September 2018 to witness tampering and conspiring against the United States. The conviction came as a result of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nMueller's report concluded the interference was conducted with government knowledge and direction. Because of his past and current involvement with Russian intelligence, experts have argued the measures to hack into the U.S. election system would not have been done without Putin's approval.\n\nPresident Trump was pressed during a media briefing following his phone conversation with Putin whether or not he told Putin his country was to no longer interfere with U.S. elections. \n\nHe responded: \"We didn't discuss that.\"\n\n\n\nVenezuela\n\n\n\nVenezuela President Nicolas Maduro faces increased pressure to step down from power as protestors and defected military personnel have stepped up their attempts to seize control of the country for opposition leader Juan Guaido. Guaido was sworn in by the National Assembly in January as the United Nations-recognized interim president of Venezuela; however, Maduro has refused to step down and maintains control of the nation through the military. \n\nSensing possible military intervention by the United States, Russia has recently sent some of its own personnel and advisors to the country to support Maduro. Maduro has been described as a socialist.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday said Maduro is \"ruling for the moment.\"\n\n\"We've supported the National Assembly's choice,\" Pompeo told ABC News. \"Juan Guaido is the interim president of the country\u2026these things sometimes have bumpy roads. (Maduro's) ruling for the moment, but he can't govern. There's enormous poverty, enormous starvation, sick children that can't get medicine\u2026This is not someone who can be part of Venezuela's future and whether that change take place today or tomorrow or a week from now, one can't predict.\"\n\nPompeo concluded by stating that eventually the people will demand that Maduro leave. Previously, Russia has warned the U.S. about interfering with any transition in government.\n\nNational security advisor John Bolton stated May 1: \u201cThis is our hemisphere \u2014 it\u2019s not where the Russians ought to be interfering. This is a mistake on their part. It\u2019s not going to lead to an improvement in relations.\u201d\n\nThere are many in the global intelligence community who see Russia's actions as continual baits to check the temperament of U.S. intelligence and military.\n\n\u201cWhat the Russians seem to have effectively figured out is how to call our bluff,\u201d Fernando Cutz, a former top National Security Council official under Trump told Politico. \u201cWhen they send troops into Georgia, or Ukraine, or Syria, or Venezuela, what are we going to do about it? It complicates our calculus and gives Russia the upper hand.\u201d\n\nFollowing Friday's phone call, both Putin and Trump have pledged to work together to deliver humanitarian aid to Venezuela.\n\n\n\nMilitary advancement\n\n\n\nRussia continues to expand its military presence around the world. In April, the Russian navy launched the Belgorod submarine. The sub has the distinction of being the world's longest submarine according to a report by Popular Mechanics. It is designed to perform a number of military operations, including serving as a mobile base from which smaller subs can be launched. Belgorod is also armed with Poseidon long-range intercontinental torpedoes, which are nuclear powered and nuclear armed. The Russian military is also reportedly attempting to accomplish the same with intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\nBelgorod, which is 600 feet long, can dive to 1,700 feet. It also can displace 30,000 tons of water when submerged. Belgorod can reportedly carry up to six Poseidon missiles, each with a 2-megaton thermonuclear warhead. The torpedoes are designed to go around U.S. missile defenses to strike coastal targets.\n\nA massive submarine is not the only development the Russian navy is involved in according to some maritime warfare experts. On April 26, the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries announced it had come into contact with a rather friendly beluga whale bearing a harness with the words \"Equipment St. Petersburg.\" The harness featured a mounting bracket some believe could be used to attach some sort of device, such as a camera to the beluga. Others believe it could also be used to attach a weapon. The notion is not out of the realm of possibility, as a major Russian naval base lies just on the Russian side of the border with Norway, granting quick access to the North Sea and the North Atlantic.\n\nAlthough Russia's use of marine mammals in recent times has been kept quiet, the use of dolphins in planting and detonating underwater mines was the focus of a military project in the past. In fact, the Russian government in 2016 posted an advertisement to secure three male and two female bottlenose dolphins, offering $24,000 for all five. \n\nMore than a week later, the beluga is still in the waters off Hammerfest, Norway, approaching fishing vessels in a friendly manner and at times gently bumping them, indicating it wants to be fed. As with previous marine mammal operations, the Russian government is denying any involvement. \n\n\n\nRelations with Iran\n\n\n\nThe Iranian navy has announced it will conduct joint military exercises with Russia later this year. The move is not unusual, considering the two navies have conducted joint exercises in the Caspian Sea in recent years. But, much like the U.S. Navy's long-running exercises with South Korea, the continued naval cooperation between Iran and Russia implies a unified front \u2014 one which could pose threat to the U.S. Navy if intervention in the waters off Iran's coast is deemed necessary. Iran is at an advantage due to the amount of coastline it has along the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe Trump administration recently announced starting this month it will no longer grant waivers for allied countries wishing to buy oil from Iran. Waivers keep certain nations from facing repercussions for buying oil from Iran as opposed to neighboring Saudi Arabia. Iran in some cases is seen as more desirable due to open maritime access to the country's north via the Caspian Sea. Such a route enables a route to not only Russia but many European Union countries. The Republic of Korea, Japan and Turkey are among the current buyers. Saudi oil has to go out through either the Red Sea on the west or Persian Gulf on the east, adding more time to maritime travel. \n\nAt the same time as Trump's announcement or removing waivers, the Saudi Arabian government announced it will raise the price of oil to $85 per barrel.\n\nChina's Xinhua News reported on April 28 that Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, suggested his country may leave the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as an option for the U.S. re-imposition of sanctions. Sanctions were re-imposed on Iran in November 2018 on Iran's banking, energy and shipping industries. \n\nZarif noted that the previous 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which Trump has since pulled out of, was an example of being able to negotiate to remove sanctions. Zarif also denied Iran ever failed to live up to its commitments, and it was the U.S. that failed to live up to its commitments in the plan. The plan faced criticism by Republicans in Congress who claimed the Iranians were enriching Uranium for the purpose of creating nuclear weapons. The Iranians have insisted from the beginning that its reactors are for producing nuclear power.\n\n\n\nNuclear arms\n\n\n\nOn April 24, Xinhua News reported the U.S. deployment of missile defense systems near Russia's borders amongst the U.S. allied nations. Viktor Poznikhir, first deputy chief of the Russian General Staff's Main Operations Directorate, said by the U.S. developing such a system, it is also seeking \"to have the opportunity of delivering such a blow to any country it dislikes. Poznikhir said Russia has taken its own retaliatory measures, including the development of the Sarmat and Avangard missile systems. The first deputy claims the system can overcome the U.S. missile shield. Ally countries where the U.S. missile system are held were warned that they would be \"priority objects of destruction,\" and Poznikhir reminded those attending the eighth Moscow Conference on International Security that nuclear warheads also lead to radioactive contamination of land. He noted Russia is not interested in a strategic arms race and urged the U.S. to return to the negotiating table for constructive dialogue.\n\nBoth Putin and Trump recently pulled out of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty after each leader accused the other of showing no interest in abiding by its provisions. However, Friday's call with both leaders provides hope for improved relations on the nuclear capability front. There is intent expressed to re-negotiate the New START Treaty, which would require the U.S. and Russia to cut their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550, as well as limit delivery systems. The treaty also extends transparency measures requiring each side to allow the other to carrot out 10 inspects per year of nuclear bases, give 24 hours notice before new missiles under the treaty leave factories, and provide advance notice of any ballistic missile launches.\n\nThe New START Treaty, which was enacted in 2011, is set for expiration in 2021.

Despite efforts so far by the others to keep the deal from collapsing, Iran's economy has been struggling and its currency has plummeted in value after the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions.\n\nLater Wednesday, Trump issued an executive order announcing new sanctions targeting Iran's steel, aluminum, copper and iron sectors, which provide foreign currency earnings for Tehran.\n\nMany international corporations are reluctant to risk running afoul of Washington and have severed ties with Iran; a complicated barter-type system set up by the Europeans to allow their businesses to skirt direct financial transactions with Iran \u2014 and thus evade possible U.S. sanctions \u2014 is not yet finalized.\n\nIran has continued abiding by the stipulations of the deal, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, but had been expressing increasing frustration with the inability of the Europeans to provide economic relief, culminating with Wednesday's threat to resume higher enrichment of uranium in 60 days unless new terms are negotiated.\n\nDespite Rouhani's threatening rhetoric and the now-ticking clock, Europeans were cautiously hoping the Iranian president was not on the verge of breaking the deal but instead seeking to show strength domestically as the economy slumps.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said his office had been in contact with all the others involved in the Iran deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, since the announcement to see what could be done to get Tehran to back down.\n\n\"Our opinion is and remains: We want to preserve the agreement, in particular to prevent Iran from coming into possession of nuclear weapons,\" he told reporters. \"We don't need further escalation in the region.\"\n\nSimilarly, French Defense Minister Florence Parly told BFMTV television that \"nothing would be worse than Iran leaving this deal.\"\n\n\"We absolutely want to keep this agreement alive,\" Parly said.\n\nAt a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in London, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called Iran's threat \"unwelcome\" and urged it not to take \"further escalatory steps,\" while emphasizing Britain was not ready to give up on the JCPOA.\n\n\"For as long as Iran keeps its commitments then so, too, will the United Kingdom,\" he said.\n\nHunt said Britain and the U.S. agreed on the need to confront the threat from Iran, but \"it's no secret we have a different approach on how best to achieve that.\"\n\nPompeo was restrained in his own assessment of the letter that Iran sent to the JCPOA group outlining its intentions.\n\n\"I think it was intentionally ambiguous,\" he said. \"We'll have to wait to see what Iran's actions actually are.

For the past year, it\u2019s continued to abide by those terms despite U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the accord and reimpose U.S. sanctions. Now Iran is threatening to walk away. It has told the Europeans who signed the pact that if they can\u2019t find a way to ease its economic isolation in 60 days, it will abandon limits on uranium enrichment, shortening the time the country would need to accumulate sufficient material for a nuclear bomb.\n\nThe U.S. stepped up its economic pressure on Iran in early May by allowing the expiration of waivers that had permitted eight governments to buy Iranian oil. The Trump administration\u2019s aim is to drive Iran\u2019s oil exports, which account for almost half of the country\u2019s sales abroad, to zero. Already, U.S. sanctions have driven Iran\u2019s economy into recession, with the International Monetary Fund predicting a 6 percent contraction this year after 4 percent last year. The downturn is an embarrassment for President Hassan Rouhani, who championed the nuclear deal as a way to end Iran\u2019s isolation and revive its economy.\n\n2. What\u2019s enriching uranium got to do with the economy?\n\nNothing, directly. Iran is threatening to resume enriching uranium beyond levels permitted in the 2015 accord as a way to push France, Germany, the U.K. and the European Union to do something to relieve the effects of the U.S. sanctions. Those countries share the desire to restrain Iran\u2019s nuclear activities and to do so through dialogue. Also, Iran considers the limitations on its nuclear program a constraint on its sovereign rights, though it has always denied pursuing a nuclear weapon. It was willing to go along with the restrictions in exchange for sanctions relief, but the U.S. withdrawal left Iranians feeling they\u2019d been duped.\n\n3. How does the U.S. stop others from trading with Iran?\n\nAs with other sanctions campaigns, U.S. leverage rests with the central role American banks -- and the U.S. dollar -- play in the global economy. Any country, company or bank that violates the terms of the U.S. sanctions could see its U.S.-based assets blocked or lose the ability to move money to or through accounts held in the U.S. In essence, the Trump administration has bet that nations, banks and businesses worldwide would rather do business with the U.S. than Iran, a wager that has proven correct as major European companies have mostly stayed away.\n\n4. What have European countries proposed to do about that?\n\nEuropean signatories devised a special mechanism to facilitate trade with Iran that would circumvent a global financial system that is largely dominated by the U.S. The idea basically comes down to using a barter system in which Iran would accrue credits for its exports to Europe which it could then use to purchase goods from European businesses. But Instex, as the vehicle is known, isn\u2019t yet fully operational and would likely offer only limited relief.\n\n5. What\u2019s at stake in the conflict?\n\nThe stability of the Middle East. European officials frequently cite their inability to prevent U.S. President George W. Bush\u2019s administration from starting the Iraq war in 2003 as a key reason for trying to salvage the Iran deal. The U.S. and Iran are still far from declaring war on each other, and U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo responded cautiously to Iran\u2019s announcement, saying \u201cit was intentionally ambiguous.\u201d But tensions are mounting. Just before Iran\u2019s ultimatum, the U.S. said it was deploying an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf in response to unspecified threats from Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already warned that his country would confront any Iranian move to develop a nuclear weapon.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: David Wainer in New York at dwainer3@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Bill Faries at wfaries@bloomberg.net, Lisa Beyer", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-08/why-the-u-s-iran-conflict-is-now-coming-to-a-head-quicktake", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": null}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9999320232920649, "vector": [0.08612749436415454, 0.34629687313765456, 0.0, 6.0], "id": 70118}], "id": "9a8aad5f-fa7d-4606-8b87-830060addb6e", "title": "The Latest: Iran steps away from parts of nuclear deal", "text": "The Latest: Iran steps away from parts of nuclear deal\n\nTEHRAN, Iran (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Iran's decision to step away from embattled nuclear deal (all times local):\n\nIran's president says the Islamic Republic will keep its excess enriched uranium and heavy water, setting a 60-day deadline for new terms for its nuclear deal.\n\nHassan Rouhani said Wednesday that if that deadline passes without better terms, Iran will begin higher enrichment of uranium.\n\nHe made the comments in a live address on Wednesday, the anniversary of President Donald Trump pulling America out of the accord.\n\nThe 2015 deal saw sanctions on Iran lifted in exchange for limits on its nuclear program.

Despite efforts so far by the others to keep the deal from collapsing, Iran's economy has been struggling and its currency has plummeted in value after the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions.\n\nLater Wednesday, Trump issued an executive order announcing new sanctions targeting Iran's steel, aluminum, copper and iron sectors, which provide foreign currency earnings for Tehran.\n\nMany international corporations are reluctant to risk running afoul of Washington and have severed ties with Iran; a complicated barter-type system set up by the Europeans to allow their businesses to skirt direct financial transactions with Iran \u2014 and thus evade possible U.S. sanctions \u2014 is not yet finalized.\n\nIran has continued abiding by the stipulations of the deal, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, but had been expressing increasing frustration with the inability of the Europeans to provide economic relief, culminating with Wednesday's threat to resume higher enrichment of uranium in 60 days unless new terms are negotiated.\n\nDespite Rouhani's threatening rhetoric and the now-ticking clock, Europeans were cautiously hoping the Iranian president was not on the verge of breaking the deal but instead seeking to show strength domestically as the economy slumps.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said his office had been in contact with all the others involved in the Iran deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, since the announcement to see what could be done to get Tehran to back down.\n\n\"Our opinion is and remains: We want to preserve the agreement, in particular to prevent Iran from coming into possession of nuclear weapons,\" he told reporters. \"We don't need further escalation in the region.\"\n\nSimilarly, French Defense Minister Florence Parly told BFMTV television that \"nothing would be worse than Iran leaving this deal.\"\n\n\"We absolutely want to keep this agreement alive,\" Parly said.\n\nAt a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in London, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called Iran's threat \"unwelcome\" and urged it not to take \"further escalatory steps,\" while emphasizing Britain was not ready to give up on the JCPOA.\n\n\"For as long as Iran keeps its commitments then so, too, will the United Kingdom,\" he said.\n\nHunt said Britain and the U.S. agreed on the need to confront the threat from Iran, but \"it's no secret we have a different approach on how best to achieve that.\"\n\nPompeo was restrained in his own assessment of the letter that Iran sent to the JCPOA group outlining its intentions.\n\n\"I think it was intentionally ambiguous,\" he said. \"We'll have to wait to see what Iran's actions actually are. They have made have made a number of statements about actions they have threatened to do in order to get the world to jump.\"\n\nIn his television address, Rouhani also tried a gambit designed to hit a sore spot for Europe, over the issue of migration and drug-smuggling.\n\nNoting that Iran now cooperates on issues like controlling immigration and targeting Afghan opium and hashish traffickers, he said: \"You are obliged ... for your own security, for protecting your youths against drugs as well as controlling influx of immigrants.\"\n\nThere was no immediate response from officials in Europe, which has seen an influx of refugees and migrants from the Middle East in recent years.\n\nChina, a key Iranian ally and trading partner, suggested that Washington's recent decision to deploy an aircraft carrier group and a bomber wing to the Middle East to confront unspecified threats from Tehran had added fuel to the fire.\n\n\"We regret that the U.S. has further aggravated the tension on the Iranian nuclear issue,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. \"We call on all parties concerned to exercise restraint, strengthen dialogue and avoid escalating tensions.\"\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov went a step further, saying the situation surrounding the fate of the 2015 nuclear accord has been complicated by \"irresponsible behavior\" from Washington.\n\nAfter meeting in Moscow with his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif, Lavrov reaffirmed Russia's support for the deal and blamed the U.S. for undermining it.\n\n\"The U.S. is to blame for the situation and it makes it difficult for both Iran to fulfill its obligations and ... for the general state of the nuclear non-proliferation regime,\" Lavrov said.\n\nZarif insisted that Iran's decision to partially withdraw from certain provisions did not violate the agreement, and asserted it was provoked by U.S. actions toward Iran.\n\nHe also said Iran will uphold its obligations if European signatories to the deal uphold theirs.\n\nAssociated Press writers Matthew Lee and Jill Lawless in London, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Elaine Ganley in Paris, Lorne Cook in Brussels and Matthew Bodner in Moscow contributed.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/europeans-struggle-preserve-iran-nuclear-accord-62913017", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": "2020-10-06 11:42:49.484149+00:00"}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9995476199689148, "vector": [0.05360747108210995, 0.20894295388850884, 1.0, 6.0], "id": 70118}], "id": "f767b354-fe1d-4b78-9f16-0df750c0a062", "title": "India, China seen as Europe's last hope to save Iran deal - Times of India", "text": "BRUSSELS/PARIS/BERLIN: The European Union will defend the Iran nuclear accord despite Tehran 's decision to backtrack on its commitments in response to US sanctions , diplomats believe, but European powers expect it to collapse without a deal to sell Iranian oil to China or India.Britain, France and Germany, which signed the 2015 deal along with the United States, China and Russia, are determined to show they can compensate for last year's US withdrawal from the accord, protect trade and still prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear bomb But with Iran's economy dependent on crude exports that are traded in US dollars, a promised European trade channel to bypass American sanctions has proved complicated, is not yet operational, and may never be able to handle oil sales.\"This situation now risks deteriorating, but it will be step by step and not a collapse all in one go,\" said a senior European diplomat. A French diplomat talked of a \"negative spiral\" in which trade in food and medicines was simply not enough, while another European envoy spoke of Iran's \"phased exit\" from the deal.The Iran accord, one of the West's biggest foreign policy achievements until US President Donald Trump pulled out in May 2018, lifted punishing United Nations ' sanctions on Iran in return for Iranian compliance with the deal.Iran has met its terms but Trump withdrew because he believes the accord did not curtail Tehran's ballistic missile programme or address Iranian involvement in Syria's civil war, something Europeans argue the 2015 deal was not designed to do.By reimposing punitive sanctions, the United States says it aims to dramatically weaken Iran's clerical rulers and force Tehran to renegotiate a broader arms control deal.The European Union says that can still be done without tearing up the nuclear accord, which put strict limits on Iranian enrichment.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned on Wednesday that Tehran could resume enrichment at a higher grade if the European powers, China and Russia did not do more to circumvent US sanctions on banking and energy to boost trade.European diplomats and officials reject any ultimatum and some believe they still have time to save the deal. One senior EU official said it is too early to consider European sanctions that can snap back in case of Iranian non-compliance.\"Iran's announcements are not a violation or a withdrawal of the nuclear deal,\" the senior EU official said. \"It is for the International Atomic Energy Agency to assess Iran's compliance ... if Iran breaches the agreement, then we would react.\"Others are more pessimistic.Once Europe's biggest supplier, Iran has seen its exports gradually cut off from European buyers by sanctions, starting last November and then on May 2, when Washington removed the last waivers to Italy and Greece. China, India and Turkey are also among those who lost their waivers this months.EU officials estimate Iran needs to sell about 1.5 million barrels a day to keep its economy afloat, but sales risk falling below 1 million a day, bringing hardship and potentially economic crisis to Iranians.The EU's special trade channel, known as Instex, was proposed by Russia as a barter system for Iranian oil in exchange for European goods, but it may not be operating before the end of June and its capability is limited.\"Instex isn't the solution because it will only serve food and medicine needs, not oil,\" a second European diplomat said. \"Anyway, the structure is not completed.\"Led by a German banker, Instex relies on Iran to set up a so-called mirror company that must meet international anti-fraud requirements. Officials and diplomats say progress is slow.Draft laws are still pending, while a lack of transparency in Iran's financial system is also a problem. The US decision to sanction Iran's Revolutionary Guard (IRGC), which controls part of Iran's economy, is another complication.\"As a partner to Iran, those who use Instex have to be extremely vigilant that at the other end of the operation it doesn't benefit entities linked to the IRGC,\" the European diplomat said.Europe's plan B is for China or India to buy Iranian oil.China, which increased imports of Iranian crude in April, says it opposes unilateral US sanctions against Iran and will defend the rights of its companies. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the Iran deal should be fully and effectively implemented, although it was not clear what China would do to support it.India, Iran\u2019s biggest oil client after China, has by contrast almost halved its Iran oil purchase since November. So far, Indian officials have said they will seek oil from other suppliers.EU officials say Delhi has expressed interest in joining Instex to buy Iran's oil, but discussions have barely begun, and questions remain about whether this is even feasible.\"It shows Europe's impotence that they are pushing China and India to do what they can't,\" said Sanam Vakil, a senior research fellow with the Middle East North Africa programme at Chatham House.\"I'm not sure the Europeans are thinking in a big way about what to do. It's very clear there are no meaningful economic options they can offer Iran,\" she said.EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini met Chinese state councillor Wang Yi on the margins of a China-EU summit in Brussels in April and discussed whether China could buy Iranian oil, three EU officials said.China can still do that but would risk US sanctions.Beijing has also held talks with Washington over the issue, the officials said, but it was not clear how far they had progressed.\"The Iranians say the Europeans must do more, but what about the Chinese and the Russians? They have not done much. The Chinese have dragged their feet in several areas because of US sanctions,\" a third European diplomat said.Vakil said the three European powers should focus on high-level diplomacy to kick-start negotiations between the deal's remaining stakeholders and Washington to preserve the accord.\"It will (die) without a mandated effort on behalf of the E3 to keep the deal alive,\" she said.", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-and-india-seen-as-europes-last-hope-to-save-iran-deal/articleshow/69255721.cms", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": null}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9462238270367606, "vector": [0.1246611827368472, 0.13053187503733898, 0.0, 3.0], "id": 70118}], "id": "83464291-5c73-4688-9b26-278ebde474cf", "title": "US sanctions take heavy toll on Iranian economy", "text": "One year after Washington's unilateral withdrawal from the nuclear deal, the Iranian economy continues to suffer the economic toll due to falling oil exports and rising inflation, while Tehran is expecting European parties in the deal to take necessary steps against U.S. sanctions. Iran has the third-largest oil reserves among the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia.\n\nData from the Iranian National Oil Company shows that the proven oil reserves of the country equals 158.4 billion barrels per day in 2015 and 2016 and its gas reserves are estimated to be 33.5 trillion cubic meters.\n\nThe oil exports of hydrocarbon-rich nation have begun to incrementally decline when U.S. President Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of the U.S. from Joint Plan of Comprehensive Action (JPCOA) inked by five members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and the European Union in 2015 and began implementation in 2016. After the decision, the U.S. sanctions on Iran's financial and automotive sectors and oil industry took effect on Aug. 7, 2018 and Nov. 5, 2018, respectively.\n\nAfter the second phase of sanctions entered into force in November 2018, Washington granted waivers to eight largest buyers of Iranian crude, including Turkey, Taiwan, China, India, Italy, Greece and South Korea. However, on May 2, the six-month period for those waivers ended and the U.S. administration decided not to extend them any longer. During this period, Tehran's oil exports fell by as much as 1 million barrels per day.\n\nThe OPEC data put forward that Iran's crude oil production was 3.8 million barrels per day while it exported 2.3 million barrels per day in early 2018.\n\nIn March this year, production was only around 2.5 million barrels per day, the OPEC data showed.\n\nIn April 2018, the Iranian Petroleum Ministry said, the country exported 2.87 million barrels of oil and condensate while India and China accounted for nearly half of those exports with 1.4 million barrels in total.\n\nWhile Asian buyers purchased 60 percent of Iranian oil in April last year, 40 percent of exports went to Turkey, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the European Union. The Persian Gulf nation sold 2.7 million barrels of oil per day to the global markets last year in May. However, in March, Iran's oil exports dropped to 1.1 million to 1.7 million barrels per day on average, according to various tanker tracking platforms.\n\nWhile Taiwan, Greece and Italy stopped buying oil from Iran, its two largest customers reduced oil imports from the country by 39 percent and 47 percent, respectively.\n\nMore specifically, China, which is the biggest customer of Iranian oil, had bought 725,000 barrels of oil per day before the sanctions kicked in. India, Iran's top oil client after China, shipped in more than 700,000 barrels of oil per day last year in June 2018 but the figure fell to 277,600 barrels in April, the Indian media reported.\n\nThe other two Asian buyers, Japan and South Korea, imported 292,648 barrels and 334,387 barrels of oil from Iran, respectively. While South Korea's imports corresponded to a 10.6 percent decline compared to the same period of last year, Japan's purchases of Iranian crude oil recorded a 48.8 percent rise.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the data of the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA) showed that Iran exported 349,837 tons of oil to Turkey in February this year. Last year in the same month, Iran was the top supplier of Turkey's oil imports with 643,294 tons of oil. Therefore, imports from Iran recorded a dramatic 54 percent fall in February, compared to the same month of last year.\n\nThe dramatic decline is estimated to cost the Tehran regime nearly $10 billion loss in revenues. Before the sanctions, Iran's revenues from oil exports were estimated at $52 billion.\n\nThe decline in the main source of revenues and the heavy investment in the Syrian war caused a major blow to the Iranian currency. The depreciation took a steeper course with the announcement of U.S. sanctions last year.\n\nIran's rial currency extended its fall on Tuesday, hovering around a seven-month low against the U.S. dollar, foreign exchange websites said, as tensions rose and Washington said it was sending an aircraft carrier and bombers to the region.\n\nThe rial plunged to 155,500 to the dollar on the unofficial market yesterday compared to 150,500 rials on Monday, the currency's lowest value since early October 2018, according to Bonbast.com. The bazar360.com website said the dollar was being sold for between 153,500 and 149,500 rials.\n\nOn May 7, 2018, the rial was trading at 65,000 against the greenback, the data of the Bonbast.com demonstrated. Therefore, the Iranian rial tumbled nearly 135 percent against the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe reeling rial has been attributed to the deepening economic problems and high demand for foreign currency among ordinary Iranians who sought to buy currency on the black market.\n\nThe tumbling rial has led to a shortage of imported goods and products manufactured from raw materials imported from abroad.\n\nThe crisis in the economy, however, has not been manifest in the national currency, reflecting huge outcomes in the macroeconomic outlook and data. International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Iran's economy shrank by 3.9 percent last year and is expected to shrink by 6 percent in 2019.\n\nFollowing the implementation of JCPOA in January 2016, the Iranian economy had registered considerable growth. According to a report of the Central Bank of Iran, the country's economy grew 12.5 percent during April 2016-March 2017 in comparison to 2015.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani managed to decrease inflation as low as 9 percent in 2017.

But last week it said it would now end the waivers to reduce Iran's crude exports to zero.\n\nThe administration also blacklisted Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps as terrorists. The Guards control a large swathe of Iranian industry, so their blacklisting could make it harder for foreign companies to do business with Iran.\n\nIran has responded by declaring all U.S. forces in the Middle East to be terrorists. It has also made threats to close the strategic Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf if Tehran were barred from using it. Around 30 percent of the world's seaborne oil exports pass through the strait.\n\nWhile neither Shanahan nor Bolton elaborated on the gist of U.S. intelligence, other U.S. officials told Reuters there were \"multiple, credible threats\" against U.S. forces on land, including in Iraq, by Iran and proxy forces, and at sea.\n\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\n\nYour guide to the latest election news, analysis, commentary, live updates and schedule for Lok Sabha Elections 2019 on firstpost.com/elections.

Despite efforts so far by the others to keep the deal from collapsing, Iran's economy has been struggling and its currency has plummeted in value after the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions.\n\nLater Wednesday, Trump issued an executive order announcing new sanctions targeting Iran's steel, aluminum, copper and iron sectors, which provide foreign currency earnings for Tehran.\n\nMany international corporations are reluctant to risk running afoul of Washington and have severed ties with Iran; a complicated barter-type system set up by the Europeans to allow their businesses to skirt direct financial transactions with Iran \u2014 and thus evade possible U.S. sanctions \u2014 is not yet finalized.\n\nIran has continued abiding by the stipulations of the deal, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, but had been expressing increasing frustration with the inability of the Europeans to provide economic relief, culminating with Wednesday's threat to resume higher enrichment of uranium in 60 days unless new terms are negotiated.\n\nDespite Rouhani's threatening rhetoric and the now-ticking clock, Europeans were cautiously hoping the Iranian president was not on the verge of breaking the deal but instead seeking to show strength domestically as the economy slumps.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said his office had been in contact with all the others involved in the Iran deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, since the announcement to see what could be done to get Tehran to back down.\n\n\"Our opinion is and remains: We want to preserve the agreement, in particular to prevent Iran from coming into possession of nuclear weapons,\" he told reporters. \"We don't need further escalation in the region.\"\n\nSimilarly, French Defense Minister Florence Parly told BFMTV television that \"nothing would be worse than Iran leaving this deal.\"\n\n\"We absolutely want to keep this agreement alive,\" Parly said.\n\nAt a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in London, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called Iran's threat \"unwelcome\" and urged it not to take \"further escalatory steps,\" while emphasizing Britain was not ready to give up on the JCPOA.\n\n\"For as long as Iran keeps its commitments then so, too, will the United Kingdom,\" he said.\n\nHunt said Britain and the U.S. agreed on the need to confront the threat from Iran, but \"it's no secret we have a different approach on how best to achieve that.\"\n\nPompeo was restrained in his own assessment of the letter that Iran sent to the JCPOA group outlining its intentions.\n\n\"I think it was intentionally ambiguous,\" he said. \"We'll have to wait to see what Iran's actions actually are.

He gave a 60-day deadline for new terms to the nuclear accord, after which Tehran would resume higher uranium enrichment.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to negotiate, within the boundaries of JCPOA,\u201d he said referring to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal. \u201cIt is not us who has left the negotiation table.\u201d\n\nIn November, the United States reimposed sanctions that have strangled Iran\u2019s oil and banking sectors as well as its foreign trade. The sanctions came after the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withdraw from the pact that Iran negotiated with world powers in 2015, and that curbed its nuclear program in exchange for widespread sanctions relief.\n\nRouhani\u2019s speech coincided with the first anniversary of the U.S. withdrawal and came amid heightened American economic and military pressure on Iran, including the deployment of an aircraft carrier to the Middle East that U.S. officials say was in response to credible indications Tehran planned to attack U.S. interests in the region.\n\nThe measures announced by Rouhani came after speculation that Iran would take a more provocative approach, including fully exiting the accord or moving immediately to higher uranium enrichment. It was unclear whether the less dramatic moves it adopted would prevent a further unraveling of the deal or forestall additional punitive measures by allies or adversaries.\n\n\u201cToday, nothing would be worse than Iran, itself, leaving this accord,\u201d French Defence Minister Florence Parly told France\u2019s BFMTV on Wednesday.\n\nAsked whether Iran could face sanctions as a result of its decision, Parly said: \u201cProbably.

On Friday, the State Department announced new restrictions on Iran\u2019s civil nuclear program, despite protests by European allies.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from the White House to the Iranian announcement. Rouhani sent a letter notifying the signatories to the nuclear deal of Iran\u2019s reduced commitments on Wednesday, according to IRNA, the official state news agency of Iran.\n\nThe signatories \u2013 Britain, France, Germany and the European Union, in addition to Russia and China \u2013 have continued to support the nuclear accord and have been unable to hinder the White House\u2019s determination to isolate Iran.\n\nIn recent weeks, Iranian officials have indicated that the country could begin enriching uranium levels beyond what is permitted by the nuclear accord or limit access to the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s monitors.\n\nUranium fuel used in power plants only needs to be enriched to a low level, however, when it is enriched to much higher levels it can be used to produce weapons.\n\nUltimately, though, \u201cthe Iranians certainly tried to find the mildest first step here, which would both pressure the Europeans and appease their domestic constituents without provoking a strong reaction from the US, and angering the Russians too much,\u201d Ariane Tabatabai, an associate political scientist at the RAND Corporation, said in a text message.\n\n\u201cIran says it\u2019ll stop adhering to the stockpile limits in the deal but in practice, it may not actually go above those limits \u2013 that remains to be seen,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re making the decision now to stop adhering to the limit and tomorrow they\u2019ll go above it.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif separately will write to the European Union, the agency said.\n\nThe semi-official ISNA news agency reported late Tuesday that Zarif had left for Moscow to meet with Russian leader Vladimir Putin to discuss bilateral and international issues, without elaborating.\n\nDetails of the letters, all to signers of the 2015 accord, will not be publicly disclosed, it said.\n\nThe letters will come as officials in the Islamic Republic previously warned that Iran might increase its uranium enrichment, potentially pulling away from a deal it has sought to salvage for months.\n\nAlready, the White House has announced the deployment of a U.S. aircraft carrier and a bomber wing to the Persian Gulf because of potential threats from Iran. A U.S. official in Washington said Tuesday the intelligence information which prompted that move included indications Iran had put short-range ballistic missiles aboard boats in or near the Persian Gulf. The official agreed to discuss the sensitive situation only on condition of not being quoted by name.\n\nRELATED: Aircraft carrier deployed after indications Iran planned attack on US forces\n\nRELATED: Trump vetoes measure to end US support of Saudi war in Yemen\n\nThe United Nations' nuclear watchdog says Iran has continued to comply with the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw it limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. But American sanctions have wreaked havoc on Iran's already-anemic economy, while promised help from European partners in the deal haven't alleviated the pain.\n\nThe U.S. last week stopped issuing waivers for countries importing Iranian crude oil, a crucial source of cash for Iran's government. It also halted waivers allowing Iran to store excess heavy water in Oman and to swap enriched uranium for raw yellowcake with Russia.\n\nTrump campaigned on a promise to tear up the deal struck by his predecessor, Barack Obama. While Trump has sought to dismantle much of Obama's policies, he particularly criticized the Iran nuclear deal for failing to address Tehran's ballistic missile program and what he described as its malign influence across the rest of the Mideast.\n\nA statement Sunday night from U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said the USS Abraham Lincoln, other ships in the carrier's strike group and a bomber wing would deploy to the Mideast. Bolton blamed \"a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings,\" without elaborating.\n\n\"The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces,\" Bolton said.\n\nIran's hard-line Javan newspaper, associated with the Revolutionary Guard, said Wednesday would \"ignite the matchstick for burning the deal.\" It suggested in its Tuesday edition that Iran may install advanced centrifuges at its Natanz facility and begin enrichment at its Fordo facility, activities prohibited under the nuclear deal.\n\nThe USS Abraham Lincoln had been in the Mediterranean Sea conducting operations alongside the USS John C. Stennis, another aircraft carrier that has twice been in the Persian Gulf in recent months. On Tuesday, U.S. military officials said the Lincoln would be skipping a planned port call in Croatia to more rapidly reach the Persian Gulf.\n\nHowever, American military officials have stopped the near-continuous presence of aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf, a pattern set following the 1991 Gulf War. American air bases spanning the region can scramble fighter jets and drones, lessening the necessity of an aircraft carrier as U.S. officials also worry about China and Russia.\n\nAlready in the Persian Gulf is a group of U.S. Navy warships led by the USS Kearsarge, an amphibious assault ship carrying troops from the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit. The Kearsarge also carries AV-8B Harrier fighter jets, MH-60 helicopters and MV-22 Osprey airplanes.\n\nAcross the wider 5th Fleet, there were 17 warships deployed, according to the most-recent count by the U.S. Naval Institute, which tracks deployments around the world.\n\nThe Bahrain-based 5th Fleet declined to comment on the White House announcement when reached by the AP on Monday.\n\nIt also remains unclear where the bomber wing would be deployed to the region. Typically, the al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, home to the forward headquarters of the U.S. military's Central Command, hosts such bomber deployments.\n\nIn late March, the Air Force acknowledged a rare gap in bomber cover in the Mideast after a squadron of B-1 Lancers left al-Udeid to return to Texas. B-52 bombers also had been deployed to the area to keep up attacks on the Islamic State group, the first time the aging aircraft had deployed to the region in 25 years.\n\nOfficials at al-Udeid, which also hosts the F-35 fighter jet, declined to answer questions from the AP. However, a statement Tuesday from Central Command said the Air Force again planned to deploy B-52s to the region.\n\nThe Trump administration, which abruptly announced in December that it was pulling out of Syria, still maintains 2,000 U.S. troops in the northern part of the war-torn country. Officials suggest they serve as a check on Iranian ambitions and help ensure that Islamic State fighters do not regroup. No significant U.S. forces have so far withdrawn from Syria.\n\nTrump has also said he has no plans to withdraw the 5,200 troops stationed in Iraq as part of a security agreement to advise, assist and support the country's troops in the fight against IS. Earlier this year, Trump angered Iraqi politicians and Iranian-backed factions by saying troops should stay there to keep an eye on neighboring Iran.\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Despite efforts so far by the others to keep the deal from collapsing, Iran's economy has been struggling and its currency has plummeted in value after the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions.\n\nLater Wednesday, Trump issued an executive order announcing new sanctions targeting Iran's steel, aluminum, copper and iron sectors, which provide foreign currency earnings for Tehran.\n\nMany international corporations are reluctant to risk running afoul of Washington and have severed ties with Iran; a complicated barter-type system set up by the Europeans to allow their businesses to skirt direct financial transactions with Iran \u2014 and thus evade possible U.S. sanctions \u2014 is not yet finalized.\n\nIran has continued abiding by the stipulations of the deal, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, but had been expressing increasing frustration with the inability of the Europeans to provide economic relief, culminating with Wednesday's threat to resume higher enrichment of uranium in 60 days unless new terms are negotiated.\n\nDespite Rouhani's threatening rhetoric and the now-ticking clock, Europeans were cautiously hoping the Iranian president was not on the verge of breaking the deal but instead seeking to show strength domestically as the economy slumps.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said his office had been in contact with all the others involved in the Iran deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, since the announcement to see what could be done to get Tehran to back down.\n\n\"Our opinion is and remains: We want to preserve the agreement, in particular to prevent Iran from coming into possession of nuclear weapons,\" he told reporters. \"We don't need further escalation in the region.\"\n\nSimilarly, French Defense Minister Florence Parly told BFMTV television that \"nothing would be worse than Iran leaving this deal.\"\n\n\"We absolutely want to keep this agreement alive,\" Parly said.\n\nAt a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in London, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called Iran's threat \"unwelcome\" and urged it not to take \"further escalatory steps,\" while emphasizing Britain was not ready to give up on the JCPOA.\n\n\"For as long as Iran keeps its commitments then so, too, will the United Kingdom,\" he said.\n\nHunt said Britain and the U.S. agreed on the need to confront the threat from Iran, but \"it's no secret we have a different approach on how best to achieve that.\"\n\nPompeo was restrained in his own assessment of the letter that Iran sent to the JCPOA group outlining its intentions.\n\n\"I think it was intentionally ambiguous,\" he said. \"We'll have to wait to see what Iran's actions actually are. They have made have made a number of statements about actions they have threatened to do in order to get the world to jump.\"\n\nIn his television address, Rouhani also tried a gambit designed to hit a sore spot for Europe, over the issue of migration and drug-smuggling.\n\nNoting that Iran now cooperates on issues like controlling immigration and targeting Afghan opium and hashish traffickers, he said: \"You are obliged ... for your own security, for protecting your youths against drugs as well as controlling influx of immigrants.\"\n\nThere was no immediate response from officials in Europe, which has seen an influx of refugees and migrants from the Middle East in recent years.\n\nChina, a key Iranian ally and trading partner, suggested that Washington's recent decision to deploy an aircraft carrier group and a bomber wing to the Middle East to confront unspecified threats from Tehran had added fuel to the fire.\n\n\"We regret that the U.S. has further aggravated the tension on the Iranian nuclear issue,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. \"We call on all parties concerned to exercise restraint, strengthen dialogue and avoid escalating tensions.\"\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov went a step further, saying the situation surrounding the fate of the 2015 nuclear accord has been complicated by \"irresponsible behavior\" from Washington.\n\nAfter meeting in Moscow with his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif, Lavrov reaffirmed Russia's support for the deal and blamed the U.S. for undermining it.\n\n\"The U.S. is to blame for the situation and it makes it difficult for both Iran to fulfill its obligations and ... for the general state of the nuclear non-proliferation regime,\" Lavrov said.\n\nZarif insisted that Iran's decision to partially withdraw from certain provisions did not violate the agreement, and asserted it was provoked by U.S. actions toward Iran.\n\nHe also said Iran will uphold its obligations if European signatories to the deal uphold theirs.\n\nAssociated Press writers Matthew Lee and Jill Lawless in London, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Elaine Ganley in Paris, Lorne Cook in Brussels and Matthew Bodner in Moscow contributed.", "url": "https://www.thetelegraph.com/news/world/article/Europeans-struggle-to-preserve-Iran-nuclear-accord-13829546.php", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": "2019-05-08 19:08:39+00:00"}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9960673941534476, "vector": [0.0, 0.224416097624156, 0.0, 5.0], "id": 70118}], "id": "4873c675-9d0f-4d94-ba2a-a9357eda8e93", "title": "Video | news.com.au \u2014 Australia\u2019s #1 news site", "text": "Western countries participating in the Iran nuclear deal, which lifts sanctions on the country in exchange for limits on the nation\u2019s nuclear programme, are warning Tehran there will be consequences if it violates the agreement.

The current lack of accountability undermines respect for the rule of law and impedes progress towards stability and security in Libya, she added.\n\n\u201cIn a country devastated by war and conflict, with great human suffering, it is past time for the protective embrace of the law to feel real and tangible to Libyans,\u201d she emphasized. The Office of the Prosecutor aims to close the impunity gap. \u201cActing within our mandates, we share a joint burden and great responsibility in this regard for the sake of all Libyans and Libya,\u201d she added, stressing: \u201cWe must not fail to deliver on that joint duty.\u201d\n\nProviding an update on cases against Said Al-Islam Qadhafi, Al-Tuhamy Mohamed Khaled and Mahmoud Mustafa Busayf Al-Werfalli, she said the individuals remain at large, pointing out that executing warrants requires the full cooperation of the Council and all parties. Indeed, progress is hampered and confidence in the Court undermined when arrest warrants remain unexecuted year after year, she noted. Meanwhile, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office continues to monitor the situation, paying close attention to conflict in and around Tripoli, where more than 50,000 people have been displaced and more than 400 killed since April, she said, adding that it is also gathering evidence of crimes against migrants, include rape and enslavement.\n\n\u201cImpunity for atrocity crimes is hardly conducive to bringing peace and stability to this war-torn country,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are aware that, given the prevailing climate of impunity in Libya, there are people who see the International Criminal Court as their only hope to hold alleged perpetrators of atrocity crimes to account.\u201d\n\nWith the floor open, many Council members condemned the recent spate of violence, expressing grave concerns about the deteriorating humanitarian situation and reiterating that all parties must return to negotiating a path towards peace. The United Kingdom\u2019s representative stressed that it is as important as ever that the Council monitor developments in Libya and return to a United Nations-led political process.\n\nMany speakers commended the International Criminal Court\u2019s efforts, with France\u2019s representative saying its role today is just as important as it was in the past. The Court must be able to carry out its prerogatives in an unfettered way, she said, emphasizing that any lasting peace requires justice for the victims. Echoing concerns about crimes against migrants, she said \u201cthese challenges cannot be overcome without the support of the Court and this Council\u201d.\n\nThe representative of the United States cautioned that in bringing perpetrators to justice, \u201cwe must also be careful in recognizing the proper tools\u201d. Underlining that the International Criminal Court has no jurisdiction over Member States that have not signed the Rome Statute, he said that does not, however, undermine the commitment of the United States to international law.\n\nExpressing a different perspective, the Russian Federation\u2019s representative said that despite the Chief Prosecutor\u2019s briefings on the situation in Libya every six months for the past eight years, the Court has generated neither momentum nor results. The conflict has deep roots, beginning with a number of States which attempted to \u201cbomb democracy\u201d into the country, he recalled. The result was chaos, migration and rampant violence, which the International Criminal Court seems to have overlooked.\n\nLibya\u2019s representative, speaking on behalf of the country\u2019s Foreign Minister, said the Government of National Accord is taking steps to protect its citizens and ensure justice is delivered. However, the current security conditions must be considered in terms of arresting individuals, he cautioned, pointing out that some of them are not even on Libyan territory. Nevertheless, the Government fully supports resolution 1970 (2011) and hopes the Council will place the situation in Libya at the top of its priority list in order to adopt a binding resolution to stop the hostilities and ensure that those who started the hostilities \u201cgo back where they came from\u201d.\n\nAlso speaking today were representative of Kuwait, Dominican Republic, Germany, Peru, China, South Africa, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Belgium, Poland, Equatorial Guinea and Indonesia.\n\nThe meeting began at 3:05 p.m. and ended at 4:41 p.m.\n\nFATOU BENSOUDA, Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, presented the seventeenth report issued by her Office pursuant to resolution 1970 (2011). Expressing regret that fighting continues across Libya, she said the Office of the Prosecutor continues to monitor the situation, paying close attention to conflict in and around Tripoli, where more than 50,000 people have been displaced and more than 400 killed since April. All parties to the conflict must take all measures to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, she said, warning that commanders failing to take all measures to prevent such crimes will be held responsible. The Office of the Prosecutor stands ready to prosecute any party, she said, emphasizing that the suffering of Libya\u2019s people must stop and the rules of international humanitarian law must be honoured.\n\nProviding an update on the case of Said Al-Islam Qadhafi, she said he has lost his admissibility challenge and filed an appeal of the Chamber\u2019s decision. Pointing out that Libya remains under obligation to arrest and surrender Mr. Qadhafi to the International Criminal Court, alongside Al-Tuhamy Mohamed Khaled and Mahmoud Mustafa Busayf Al-Werfalli, she expressed regret that securing State cooperation in the arrest and surrender of suspects remains one of the Court\u2019s greatest challenges. Despite the Court\u2019s arrest warrant against him for the war crime of murder in relation to 33 people, Mr. Al-Werfalli remains at liberty and has allegedly murdered another 10 people in five months after the warrant was issued, she said. Mr. Al-Tuhamy, former head of Libya\u2019s internal security agency, accused of crimes relating to torture, has been wanted since 2013, she added, noting that all three remain at large, with the failure to arrest them jeopardizing ongoing investigations. In the long run, this lack of accountability undermines respect for the rule of law and impedes progress towards stability and security in Libya, she said, declaring: \u201cThe status quo is not sustainable.\u201d\n\nRenewing a call for cooperation from the State and asking the Council to lend its support, she continued: \u201cImpunity for atrocity crimes is hardly conducive to bringing peace and stability to this war-torn country.\u201d The Office of the Prosecutor also continues to follow the case of tens of thousands of internally displaced persons, she said, adding that it has collected evidence of rape and enslavement committed against migrants. Implicated in the smuggling and trafficking business are individuals, militias and State actors, including from Misrata, Al-Zawiyah, Tripoli and Bani Walid. Assessing the feasibility of bringing such cases to the Court in cooperation with a number of States and organizations, she said the Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u2019s aims to close the impunity gap by helping national systems ensure accountability for crimes that may not fall within the Court\u2019s jurisdiction. Feedback from partners shows that the strategy is already proving effective, she added.\n\nExpressing appreciation for the cooperation extended by States, organizations and Libyans themselves, she said \u201cwe are aware that, given the prevailing climate of impunity in Libya, there are people who see the International Criminal Court as their only hope to hold alleged perpetrators of atrocity crimes to account\u201d. While the Prosecutor\u2019s Office takes its responsibilities seriously, progress is hampered and confidence in the Court undermined when arrest warrants remain unexecuted year after year, she said. Pointing out that executing warrants requires the full cooperation of the Council and all parties, she stressed: \u201cIn a country devastated by war and conflict, with great human suffering, it is past time for the protective embrace of the law to feel real and tangible to Libyans.\u201d She continued: \u201cActing within our mandates, we share a joint burden and great responsibility in this regard for the sake of all Libyans and Libya,\u201d stressing: \u201cWe must not fail to deliver on that joint duty.\u201d\n\nSUSAN JANE DICKSON (United Kingdom) noted the troubling humanitarian and security situation in Libya, saying \u201cincreasing instability and violence benefit no one\u201d. Calling upon those involved in the conflict to respect their obligations under international law, she noted with approval the Chief Prosecutor\u2019s determination to hold perpetrators of crime accountable. All those who breach international humanitarian law must be brought to justice, investigated and prosecuted, as appropriate, she said, calling upon all concerned to cooperate with the International Criminal Court on outstanding arrest warrants. The Court must continue its efforts to bring those who remain at large to justice. She went on to note with deep concern the deteriorating conditions for migrants, who face serious human rights violations in Libya, describing the abuses that some migrants face as appalling. The human rights of displaced persons must be respected, and it is as important as ever that the Council monitor developments in Libya and return to a United Nations-led political process, she said.\n\nBADER ABDULLAH N. M. ALMUNAYEKH (Kuwait) welcomed the efforts of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office to continue its work despite the great challenges it faces. \u201cWe share Ms. Bensouda\u2019s concern over the military clashes that have caused the displacement of thousands of people,\u201d he added. Expressing his delegation\u2019s concern about the report\u2019s references to violations against migrants, he emphasized that the Libyan authorities bear the main responsibility for ensuring justice. However, the International Criminal Court must also respect Libya\u2019s jurisdiction over cases before the national courts, he said, stressing that the International Criminal Court is a complementary mechanism.\n\nJOS\u00c9 SINGER WEISINGER (Dominican Republic) expressed concern that some 432 people have already lost their lives and 40,000 have been displaced in 2019 alone, and yet no one has been prosecuted. Emphasizing the essential need for State authorities to recognize the complementary role of international mechanisms, he called upon the Libyan authorities to cooperate effectively in the arrest of individuals against whom warrants have been issued. The Dominican Republic calls upon those countries that have not yet accepted the International Criminal Court\u2019s jurisdiction to hand perpetrators over for prosecution.\n\nJONATHAN R. COHEN (United States) reiterated calls for holding Mr. Qadhafi, Mr. Al-Tuhamy and Mr. al-Werfalli to account for alleged crimes against humanity and other crimes. He also expressed deep concern over the instability in Tripoli, saying all parties should return to the political process. The United States will work to end the human rights abuses and human trafficking that have plagued the region, he said, emphasizing that perpetrators of atrocity crimes must face justice. However, \u201cwe must also be careful in recognizing the proper tools\u201d, he cautioned. Underlining that the International Criminal Court has no jurisdiction over Member States that have not signed the Rome Statute, he said that does not, however, undermine the commitment of the United States to international law.\n\nCHRISTOPH HEUSGEN (Germany) emphasized that there is no military solution and that stakeholders must promptly return to the negotiating table. Those responsible must execute the International Criminal Court\u2019s arrest warrants without delay, he added. Libya, for its part, must do everything to ensure accountability for serious crimes and seek the Court\u2019s assistance as needed. Amid the global proliferation of violations of international law, including atrocity crimes and sexual violence in conflict, impunity must end, he said, stressing: \u201cThis cannot become a new normal.\u201d Recalling that Germany was the first to prosecute atrocity crimes, he defended the values for which the Nuremburg trials stand.\n\nGUSTAVO MEZA-CUADRA (Peru), reaffirming the value of the Rome Statute, called upon the Libyan authorities to execute the International Criminal Court\u2019s arrest warrants. He went on to note that the current situation is exacerbated by terrorist activities committed by such groups as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Da\u2019esh) and Boko Haram. He condemned recent attacks and called upon the International Criminal Court to investigate. Confidence in justice and judicial institutions is the key to preventing conflict and the Court must, therefore, remain the linchpin of the world order, he said.\n\nYAO SHAOJUN (China), highly concerned about recent developments, said he anticipates that the parties will return to negotiations with a view to building peace and stability. China stands ready to work with the international community towards a peaceful solution, he said, while emphasizing that his delegation\u2019s perspective on the International Criminal Court remains unchanged.\n\nXOLISA MABHONGO (South Africa) said his delegation remains concerned about ongoing fighting and the deteriorating humanitarian situation. Condemning the loss of civilian lives in Tripoli, he called upon all parties to respect international humanitarian law. Inclusive political dialogue is the way forward, he emphasized, urging the parties to return to negotiations. He called for examination of the causes behind the rise of terrorism in order to break the vicious cycle of conflict on the continent.\n\nCHECK IBRAHIM BAKAYOKO (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) said that attacks against the High National Election Commission, the National Oil Company and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs are a tragic demonstration of the spread of terrorism within Libya. Commending the International Criminal Court\u2019s efforts to investigate crimes in the country, he noted the warrants it issued for the arrest of Said Al-Islam Qadhafi, Al-Tuhamy Mohamed Khaled and Mahmoud Mustafa Busayf Al-Werfalli. He said peace and security are inextricably linked to human rights, emphasizing that the Libyan parties are obligated to respect human rights and civilian infrastructure.\n\nMARC PECSTEEN DE BUYTSWERVE (Belgium) emphasized that all Member States, whether party to the Rome Statute or not, must cooperate with the Court. This, of course, affects Libya first and foremost, which must cooperate by handing over Mr. Qadhafi and Mr. Al-Tuhamy for prosecution. Regarding Mahmoud Mustafa Busayf Al-Werfalli, he said it is up to the General of the Libyan army to hand him over to the Court. Deploring the resumption of fighting in and around Tripoli, he said it must be firmly stated that all those found guilty of grave violations of international humanitarian law will have to answer for their actions. The fight against impunity is vital to lasting peace in Libya, he stressed.\n\nMARIUSZ LEWICKI (Poland) called upon all parties to respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law, stressing: \u201cIt is not a matter of choice, it is a legal obligation both of States and non-State actors.\u201d All those responsible for violations of international law must be held accountable, he said, adding that the Libyan people deserve to live in peace and safety. The outcome of the Prosecutor\u2019s work depends very much on the cooperation of Member States, he pointed out. \u201cWithout cooperation, you will not move forward with your prosecutions,\u201d he added. He went on to express concern over the human rights violations committed against migrants in Libya, urging the parties to help strengthen the rule of law there.\n\nANNE GUEGUEN (France) said the International Criminal Court\u2019s role today is just as important as it was in the past. It must be able to carry out its prerogatives in an unfettered way. Any lasting peace in Libya requires justice for the victims, she said, describing the civilian population as the primary victim. Expressing concern that many terrorist and criminal groups are trying to gain ground, she said the continuation of investigations by the Office of the Prosecutor requires all cooperation, welcoming the support provided by the International Police Organization (INTERPOL) and the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL). Turning to the report\u2019s section on trafficking of human beings, she said the cases mentioned are extremely informative and concerning. \u201cThese challenges cannot be overcome without the support of the Court and this Council,\u201d she stressed.\n\nGENNADY V. KUZMIN (Russian Federation) noted that for eight years, the Prosecutor has presented a report to the Council every six months, ensuring that the International Criminal Court is working on the situation in Libya, but the Court has generated neither momentum nor results. Moreover, it seems the Court is immune to fair criticism, he added. The Libyan conflict has deep roots, beginning with a number of States which attempted to \u201cbomb democracy\u201d into the country, he recalled. Instead, that bombing caused chaos, migration and rampant violence, which the International Criminal Court seems to have overlooked. After a verdict explaining the interests of justice, in the International Criminal Court\u2019s telling, the investigation in Libya will hardly be able to produce credible results, he predicted.\n\nAMPARO MELE COLIFA (Equatorial Guinea) said the international community is waiting to see the International Criminal Court apply the criteria for war and atrocity crimes without discrimination. Dismayed at the current situation in Libya, she said a ceasefire and a return to the negotiating table must be priorities. The Libyan people have been calling for this, and the Council must act accordingly, she said. Concerned about reports of war crimes alongside violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, she said the International Criminal Court must take action using legally established procedures. Encouraging Council members and the broader United Nations membership to help in ensuring civilians and humanitarian workers are protected, she warned that the conflict is also affecting the broader population and the wider region.\n\nDIAN TRIANSYAH DJANI (Indonesia), Council President for May, spoke in his national capacity, calling for a cessation of hostilities and for all parties to return to the negotiating table so as to determine a peaceful future for Libya. Concerned about the large number of grave violations of international law and serious crimes, he called upon the parties and armed groups to respect the law and protect civilians. The violence must stop, he emphasized, urging assistance for those in need. While peace cannot be sustainable without justice, justice cannot prosper in the absence of peace, he pointed out, calling for an end to hostilities and a continuation of the peace process. He went on to stress that referring the situation in Libya to the International Criminal Court should not disarm the competent Libyan authorities from invoking their jurisdiction to investigate gross violations of human rights and bring perpetrators to justice.\n\nELMAHDI S. ELMAJERBI spoke on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Libya, recalling that the Government of National Accord sent a letter to the Council in 2019, requesting an investigation into recent violence and serious crimes against civilians in Tripoli, with a view to holding perpetrators accountable. He called upon the international community, including the International Criminal Court, to hold accountable those States and individuals helping Khalifa Haftar, saying they can be listed for sanctions. There can be no military solution to the situation in Libya, he stressed.\n\nAdministering justice on Libyan territory is the country\u2019s responsibility, he continued. At the same time, Libya is cooperating with the International Criminal Court on various cases. Emphasizing that delays in arresting suspects are linked with the ongoing violence, he pointed out that some of the individuals wanted by the Libyan authorities and the International Criminal Court live outside the country. Moreover, States that are not signatories to the Rome Statute believe they do not have an obligation to cooperate, he said. According to resolution 1970 (2011), the International Criminal Court has the right to work on cases with or without the cooperation of such countries, he clarified. From a judicial point of view, the Libyan jurisdiction is capable of prosecuting those who have committed crimes on its territory since 2011, he reiterated.\n\nResponding to elements of the Prosecutor\u2019s report, he said the Government of National Accord has taken swift measures to protect migrants in danger, relocating them away from the fighting in cooperation with the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Authorities are also monitoring the situation, including attacks against civilian infrastructure. The Government of National Accord fully supports resolution 1970 (2011) and hopes the Council will place the situation in Libya at the top of its priority list in order to adopt a binding resolution to stop the hostilities and ensure that those who started the hostilities \u201cgo back where they came from\u201d.", "url": "https://reliefweb.int/report/libya/urgent-action-needed-end-hostilities-libya-ensure-return-talks-international-criminal", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": "2020-10-06 11:42:49.485404+00:00"}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9986435596041267, "vector": [0.08271438184399074, 0.23514685154626158, 0.0, 5.0], "id": 70118}], "id": "c16616bf-7762-4b02-8768-a2eb5f2fb9f8", "title": "Japan keeping tabs on Iran decision to quit part of nuclear deal", "text": "Japan is closely following the situation after Iran suspended some commitments under an international nuclear deal and will use Tokyo's amicable ties with Tehran to ensure peace and stability in the Middle East, a government spokesman said Wednesday.\n\n\"We hope to use our traditionally friendly relations with Iran to solve problems through dialogue and achieve peace and stability in the region,\" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said, adding that Iran playing a \"constructive\" role is important.\n\n\"The Iranian government's decision is not to withdraw from the nuclear agreement and we take note of this point, the top government spokesman said at a press conference. \"We will continue to monitor the situation carefully.\"\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani said Wednesday that Tehran plans to keep more enriched uranium than allowed under the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, threatening to start higher uranium enrichment if no progress is made in negotiations with other parties within 60 days.\n\nRouhani added, however, that Iran does not plan to leave the nuclear deal, a year after U.S. President Donald Trump decided to pull the United States out of it.\n\nUnder the deal reached between Iran and six powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- the Islamic republic agreed to curb its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.\n\nJapan, a nonmember, has supported the deal intended to strengthen the nuclear nonproliferation regime.

He did not elaborate on the degree to which Iran was prepared to enrich uranium, which at high levels of enrichment can be used in nuclear weapons.\n\nRouhani said Iran wanted to negotiate new terms with remaining partners in the deal, but acknowledged that the situation was dire.\n\n\"We felt that the nuclear deal needs a surgery and the painkiller pills of the last year have been ineffective,\" Rouhani said. \"This surgery is for saving the deal, not destroying it.\"\n\nIran notified Britain, Russia, China, the European Union, France and Germany of its decision earlier Wednesday. All were signatories to the nuclear deal and continue to support it. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was to meet Wednesday in Moscow with his Russian counterpart.\n\n\"If the five countries join negotiations and help Iran to reach its benefits in the field of oil and banking, Iran will return to its commitments according to the nuclear deal,\" Rouhani said.\n\nHowever, Rouhani warned of a \"strong reaction\" if European leaders instead sought to impose more sanctions on Iran via the U.N. Security Council. He did not elaborate.\n\nRouhani also said Wednesday that if the 60 days pass without action, Iran will halt a Chinese-led effort to redesign its Arak heavy water nuclear reactor. Such reactors produce plutonium that can be used in nuclear weapons.\n\nZarif separately issued his own warning from Moscow.\n\n\"After a year of patience, Iran stops measures that (the) US has made impossible to continue,\" he tweeted. World powers have \"a narrowing window to reverse this.\"\n\nReaction came swiftly from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a staunch critic of Iran and the nuclear deal.\n\n\"I heard that Iran intends to continue its nuclear program. We will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons,\" Netanyahu said. \"We will continue to fight those who seek to take our lives, and we will thrust our roots even deeper into the soil of our homeland.\"\n\nThere was no immediate response from the U.S. However, the White House said Sunday it would dispatch the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf over what it described as a new threat from Iran.\n\nApparently responding to that, the general staff of Iran's armed forces issued a statement Wednesday applauding Rouhani's decision and warning its enemies.\n\n\"Any possible movement by them will face a regrettable response by the Iranian nation and its armed forces,\" the statement said, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.\n\nThe 2015 deal lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program. Iran reached the deal after years of negotiations, including secret talks between Iran and President Barack Obama's administration in Oman. Western governments had long feared Iran's atomic program could allow it to build nuclear weapons. Iran has always maintained its program is for peaceful purposes.\n\nThe U.S. withdrew from the deal after Trump campaigned on a pledge to tear up the document. His administration contends the deal should have included limits to Iran's ballistic missile program and what it describes as Tehran's malign regional influence.\n\nHowever, the U.N.'s atomic watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, repeatedly has verified Iran stuck to terms of the deal. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter the U.S. withdrew from the accord it restored crippling sanctions on Iran, exacerbating a severe economic crisis. The Iranian rial, which traded at 32,000 to $1 at the time of the accord, traded Wednesday at 153,500.\n\nThat Iran chose to keep its excess uranium and heavy water first, rather than abandon the accord in its entirety, indicates it still hopes to secure a deal. In years of negotiations over its nuclear program, Iran had similarly gone step-by-step in ramping up its activities while holding talks. The latest move also protects Rouhani, a relative moderate within Iran's Shiite theocracy, from criticism from hard-liners who have long maintained that Iran gave up too much in the nuclear deal.\n\nUnder the 2015 deal, Iran can keep a stockpile of no more than 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of low-enriched uranium and 130 tons of heavy water, a coolant used in nuclear reactors. That's compared to the 10,000 kilograms (22,046 pounds) of higher-enriched uranium it once had.\n\nThe U.S. last week ended deals allowing Iran to exchange its enriched uranium for unrefined yellowcake uranium with Russia, and to sell its heavy water, which is used as a coolant in nuclear reactors, to Oman. The U.S. also has ended waivers for nations buying Iranian crude oil, a key source of revenue for Iran's government.\n\nCurrently, the accord limits Iran to enriching uranium to 3.67%, which can fuel a commercial nuclear power plant. Weapons-grade uranium needs to be enriched to around 90%. However, once a country enriches uranium to around 20%, scientists say the time needed to reach 90% is halved. Iran has previously enriched to 20%.\n\n\"Whenever our demands are met, we will resume the same amount of suspended commitments, but otherwise, the Islamic Republic of Iran will suspend the implementation of other obligations step by step,\" a statement from Iran's Supreme National Security Council said Wednesday.\n\nIt added: \"The window that is now open to diplomacy will not remain open for a long time.\"\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher, as shown by the US decision over the weekend to rush an aircraft carrier group and other military assets to the Middle East to confront an unspecified Iranian threat.\n\nDemocrats used Iran\u2019s announcement as an opportunity to criticize Trump for withdrawing from the deal. Sen. Chris Murphy, Democrat-Connecticut, called it a sign of \u201cblind, meandering, escalatory\u201d foreign policy.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s moves to restart their nuclear program are a direct consequence of the Trump administration withdrawing from the Iran deal,\u201d said Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nDespite Iran\u2019s announced deadline to pull out of the remainder of the nuclear deal, there have been signs that Tehran is willing to talk. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said during a visit to New York last month that he thinks Trump wants to deal but is trying an antagonistic approach at the direction of senior aides and Middle Eastern allies.\n\n\u201cTry the language of respect,\u201d he urged him, pretending to address the president directly. \u201cIt won\u2019t kill you, believe me.\u201d\n\nTrump himself says he\u2019s ready to talk. \u201cWe call on the regime to abandon its nuclear ambitions, change its destructive behavior, respect the rights of its people and return in good faith to the negotiating table,\u201d he said in announcing the new sanctions.\n\nBrian Hook, US envoy to Iran, told reporters at the State Department that the US laid out 12 demands last year for a new Iran deal and an end to the Trump administration\u2019s maximum pressure campaign. They include an end to all uranium enrichment, ceasing all support for militant groups in the Middle East and the release of all US citizens detained in Iran on what the administration considers illegitimate grounds.\n\nThe United States, Germany, Britain, France, Russia, China and the European Union signed the 2015 deal with Iran, which lifted international sanctions in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, including restricting uranium enrichment for 10 years.\n\nOn May 8, 2018, Trump pulled out of the agreement, which he called \u201cthe worst deal in history.\u201d He said the accord should also have restrained Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and curbed Tehran\u2019s malign activities in the region and support for terror networks. The administration then re-imposed the sanctions on Iran that had been lifted when the agreement went into force.\n\nThe administration sees its move as a success.\n\nDeprived of much of its oil revenue, Iran cut its overall military spending by 28% after reaching a peak in 2017, Hook said. Inflation has risen in the Islamic Republic and the economy is in recession, forecast to shrink by 3%, while global oil prices haven\u2019t budged even as Iranian crude has been largely taken out of the market, production at a historic low.\n\n\u201cWe have made our focus around diplomatic isolation and economic pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cThat policy is working.\u201d\n\nThe other nations who signed the nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration have remained in the pact and have tried to provide Iran with enough economic incentives to keep the agreement alive.\n\nComplaining that it has not reaped the economic benefits it expected from signing the deal, Iran on Wednesday threatened to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels in 60 days if world powers fail to negotiate new terms. Iran stopped its sale of excess uranium and heavy water as a first step \u2014 something required under the deal.

The European non-performances that he seemed to have in mind are the cessation of purchases of Iranian oil and the withdrawal of bank financing for trade with Iran. Both these non-performances are a consequence of a Trump administration threat to sanction any European entities purchasing Iranian oil or engaging in financial transactions with Iranian entities.\n\nEuropean governments are now in a very awkward situation.\n\nThey can threaten the United States with retaliation for any U.S. sanctions imposed on European entities in the Iranian context in the hope that the United States will relent and provide waivers for European oil purchases and the financing of trade with Iran (beyond the very narrow range of goods envisaged under the INSTEX initiative). Until now there has been no sign of the EU having the guts to do this. However, on May 3, speaking about Cuba, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief said that \u201cthe EU considers the extra-territorial application of unilateral restrictive measures to be contrary to international law and will draw on all appropriate measures.\u201d Reuters reported this as a threat to retaliate and/or initiate dispute settlement proceedings at the World Trade Organisation (WTO).\n\nAfter going through the steps provided by Article 36 of the JCPOA\u2014to which President Rouhani referred in the course of his remarks\u2014the Europeans can notify the UN Security Council that Iran is no longer performing all of its JCPOA commitments. This would make the Trump administration\u2019s day, since the Security Council would then have to vote on whether to continue suspending pre-2016 UN sanctions, and it would only take a U.S. veto to bring that suspension to an end. An Iranian pull-out from the JCPOA would almost certainly ensue, and the nuclear non-proliferation cause (to which the Trump administration seems remarkably indifferent) would suffer.\n\nA third option would be to tolerate Iranian non-performance of the commitments President Rouhani mentioned in the hope of retaining Iran as a party and preserving the enhanced access to Iranian nuclear activities that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has enjoyed since 2015. This would hardly be a low-risk option. The odds are that Iran would respond by escalating its non-performance to a point at which the JCPOA ceased to have much, if any, nuclear non-proliferation value.\n\nThis unenviable situation is partly of the Europeans\u2019 own making. They should not have ruled out, as they did within weeks of President Trump\u2019s declaration of economic war on Iran a year ago, the option of retaliating if the United States failed to exclude Europe from the threat of extraterritorial sanctions. They should not have compounded that mistake by taking every opportunity\u2014the French in particular\u2014to echo U.S. rhetorical attacks on Iranian missile testing (a sovereign right, not outlawed by the UN) and so-called malign regional behavior (the allegation of malignity resting on a hypocritical judgement). The Europeans have soured their once healthy relations with Iran and are now suffering the consequences.\n\nOf course, Iran\u2019s decision to use non-performance to pressure Europe into confronting its \u201cally from hell\u201d is not without risk. In due course, Iran may find itself in a position where face can only be saved by pulling out of the JCPOA. That will risk the Trump administration seizing on Iranian withdrawal as a pretext for destroying Iran\u2019s military facilities, and perhaps much else (if other pretexts have not been found by then). It will cost Iran most, if not all, of the international prestige it won by signing the JCPOA. It may even lose Iran the backing of Russia and China, which care far more about the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) than does the Trump administration.\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s a grim outlook unless the Europeans can find the courage to confront the Trump administration, so as to return to performance of their JCPOA commitments and preserve a valuable nuclear agreement.", "url": "https://lobelog.com/grim-outlook-for-iran-nuclear-deal/", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": "2019-05-08 18:15:04+00:00"}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9910179667276579, "vector": [0.0302019324156183, 0.11270083789400503, 1.0, 5.0], "id": 70118}, {"probability": 0.97224135384834, "vector": [0.1932931632563931, 0.21727232275591732, 0.0, 2.0], "id": 70107}], "id": "798d9bd3-d79a-4861-a163-7148220a39b8", "title": "No time to go 'wobbly': Pompeo scolds Britain over China and Huawei", "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Britain on Wednesday it needed to change its attitude towards China and telecoms company Huawei, casting the world\u2019s second largest economy as a threat to the West similar to that once posed by the Soviet Union.\n\nPompeo questioned the attitude of Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s government towards Beijing and goaded London by saying that the late former British leader Margaret Thatcher, who was known as the Iron Lady, would have taken a much firmer line with China.\n\nHe brought a tough message to Britain, which agreed last month to allow China\u2019s Huawei Technologies a restricted role in building parts of its 5G network.\n\n\u201cNow is not the time for either of us to go wobbly,\u201d Pompeo said in a speech of the so-called special relationship, paraphrasing what Thatcher once famously told late U.S. President George H.W.

Britain has indicated it would allow the company a restricted role.\n\n\u201cAsk yourself: would the Iron Lady be silent when China violates the sovereignty of nations through corruption or coercion? Would she allow China to control the internet of the future?\u201d Pompeo said.\n\n\u201cInsufficient security will impede the United States\u2019 ability to share certain information within trusted networks. This is just what China wants \u2013 to divide Western alliances through bits and bytes, not bullets and bombs.\u201d\n\nPompeo said China steals sensitive intellectual property and sensitive commercial data in Europe, Asia, and the United States, and singled out Huawei.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese government can rightfully demand access to data flowing through Huawei and ZTE systems.

Bolton blamed \"a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings,\" without elaborating.\n\n\"The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces,\" Bolton said.\n\nIn Iran, the semi-official ISNA news agency on Monday quoted an anonymous official as saying that Rouhani planned a broadcast address Wednesday and may discuss the \"counteractions\" Tehran will take over America's withdrawal from the nuclear deal. It said Iranian officials have informed their European counterparts \u2014 with whom Iran has been trying to salvage the agreement \u2014 of the planned speech.\n\n\"Partial and total reduction of some of Iran's commitments and resumption of some nuclear activities which were ceased following (the deal) are the first step,\" ISNA said. Iranian state television and the semi-official Fars news agency similarly suggested an Iranian response loomed.\n\nA spokesman for Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Keivan Khosravi, also dismissed Bolton's comments as \"psychological warfare.\"\n\nThe United Nations' nuclear watchdog says Iran has continued to comply with the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw it limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. But American sanctions have wreaked havoc on Iran's already-anemic economy, while promised help from European partners in the deal haven't alleviated the pain.\n\nThe U.S. last week stopped issuing waivers for countries importing Iranian crude oil, a crucial source of cash for Iran's government.\n\nIt's unclear what specific threat American officials perceive coming from Iran. A U.S. official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said American troops at land and sea could be targeted.\n\nThe USS Abraham Lincoln had been in the Mediterranean Sea conducting operations alongside the USS John C. Stennis, another aircraft carrier that has twice been in the Persian Gulf in recent months.\n\nHowever, American military officials have stopped the near-continuous presence of aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf, a pattern set following the 1991 Gulf War. American air bases spanning the region can scramble fighter jets and drones, lessening the necessity of an aircraft carrier as U.S. officials also worry about China and Russia.\n\nAlready in the Persian Gulf is a group of U.S. Navy warships led by the USS Kearsarge, an amphibious assault ship carrying troops from the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit. The Kearsarge also carries AV-8B Harrier fighter jets, MH-60 helicopters and MV-22 Osprey airplanes.\n\nAcross the wider 5th Fleet, there were 17 warships deployed, according to the most-recent count by the U.S. Naval Institute, which tracks deployments around the world.\n\nThe Bahrain-based 5th Fleet declined to comment on the White House announcement when reached by the AP on Monday.\n\nIt also remains unclear what bomber wing would be deployed to the region. Typically, the al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, home to the forward headquarters of the U.S. military's Central Command, hosts such bomber deployments.\n\nIn late March, the Air Force acknowledged a rare gap in bomber cover in the Mideast after a squadron of B-1 Lancers left al-Udeid to return to Texas. B-52 bombers also had been deployed to the area to keep up attacks on the Islamic State group, the first time the aging aircraft had deployed to the region in 25 years.\n\nOfficials at al-Udeid, which also hosts the F-35 fighter jet, declined to answer questions from the AP.\n\nThe Trump administration, which abruptly announced in December that it was pulling out of Syria, still maintains 2,000 U.S. troops in the northern part of the war-torn country. Officials suggest they serve as a check on Iranian ambitions and help ensure that Islamic State fighters do not regroup. No significant U.S. forces have so far withdrawn from Syria.\n\nTrump has also said he has no plans to withdraw the 5,200 troops stationed in Iraq as part of a security agreement to advise, assist and support the country's troops in the fight against IS. Earlier this year, Trump angered Iraqi politicians and Iranian-backed factions by saying troops should stay there to keep an eye on neighboring Iran.\n\nAssociated Press writers Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, and Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.", "url": "https://www.13wmaz.com/article/news/nation-world/us-iran-tensions-rise-before-anniversary-of-nuclear-deal-pullout/507-19d42d2c-950e-4dda-8cd9-8e57e6935430", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": null}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9991445565104542, "vector": [0.03281625766348487, 0.21302192553436355, 0.0, 6.0], "id": 70118}], "id": "bfae7474-4c5f-4cb5-8fea-bf6961fbde9d", "title": "US sanctions to hit Iran's metals industry, a major employer", "text": "TEHRAN, Iran (AP) \u2014 U.S. sanctions have targeted Iran's government, its paramilitary forces and the oil exports that fund them.

The metals industry is a major employer and a rare bright spot for Iran's anemic economy.\n\nMany Iranians already feel the vise squeezing ever tighter around the country, which has caused its currency, the rial, to depreciate rapidly and push the price of nearly everything beyond the reach of ordinary consumers.\n\n\"I don't think (the U.S.) can, or wants to fight Iran ... because wars are no longer a thing,\" said Ahmad Hashemi, who sells steel products like sheet metal and beams in southern Tehran. \"Nowadays, wars are economic wars. Look at these sanctions. It's so easy.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump issued his executive order Wednesday announcing the sanctions. That came just after Iran threatened to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels in 60 days if European leaders fail to negotiate new terms of the nuclear deal to protect Iran's ability to trade on the global market.\n\nThe new sanctions are part of Trump's maximalist policy targeting Iran after he pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear deal a year ago. The United States, Germany, Britain, France, Russia, China and the European Union signed the deal in 2015, lifting international sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program.\n\nBut the Trump administration contends that the deal, reached under former President Barack Obama, should have included limits on Iran's ballistic missile program and curbed its regional influence. Supporters of the deal describe it as an important measure freezing Iran's nuclear program while offering a step toward further negotiations.\n\n\"We have imposed the toughest sanctions ever on this Iranian regime,\" said Brian Hook, a U.S. envoy for Iran. \"We have designated nearly 1,000 individuals and entities since the beginning of the administration. We have taken Iran's oil exports to historic lows. And we have stopped issuing oil waivers to those who import Iranian oil, which means zeroing out the purchases of Iranian crude.\"\n\nIran's domestic metal industry includes dozen of steel mills, mainly government-owned, that employ about 50,000 workers. Of the 25 million tons of steel produced, Iran exports over 30%, earning nearly $4 billion yearly. Its top markets have been Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq and Indonesia, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.\n\nAbout 3,000 factories and workshops produce goods for Iran's domestic market ranging from kitchen utensils and building frames to offshore oil rigs and military vehicles. It also feeds into Iran's domestic car manufacturing plants.\n\nMetal-related industries employ about 10 percent of the country's 22 million workers, a report by Iran's parliament said. How the sanctions will affect Iran's miners remains unclear. About 6 percent of its 8,840 mines produce raw materials such as iron, copper and aluminum.\n\nTehran-based economic analyst Gholamreza Kiamenhr said he believed that the sanctions on the metals industry \"possibly affects employment and production lines,\" although it won't be as crippling as those on Iran's oil industry.\n\nEsfandyar Batmanghelidj, the founder of the Iranian economic website Bourse & Bazaar, said the measures appear aimed at stoking further unrest in the country. At the end of 2017 through the start of 2018, economic protests swept across 75 cities and towns, lasting for days and resulting in the deaths of dozens of people and the arrest of hundreds more.\n\nSome demonstrations have already hit steel mills. In December, authorities detained an unspecified number of steelworkers after five weeks of protests over delays in paying salaries.\n\n\"Creating the conditions for mass unemployment \u2014 especially among the blue collar workers employed by state-owned enterprises who form the backbone of Iran's economy \u2014 is the likely aim of the Trump administration's latest round of sanctions,\" Batmanghelidj wrote.\n\nIt's also weakening the position of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the relatively moderate cleric whose signature accomplishment was the nuclear deal.\n\n\"The president should bravely admit the obvious defeat of his recent six years of strategies and resign,\" said Abdolreza Davari, a close adviser to former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a hard-liner. \"This will quickly prepare the ground for taking office by a new government that is capable to control the country in this current critical situation.\"\n\nAfter the U.S. withdrew from the nuclear accord, it restored the crippling sanctions, exacerbating Iran's economic crisis. The rial, which traded at 32,000 to $1 at the time of the accord, traded Thursday at 156,500, creeping further downward.\n\n\"Even before the latest sanctions, the previous ones already impacted our daily lives and have been effective,\" said a 52-year-old engineer who gave his name as Afshin. \"If we say they had no effect we are deceiving ourselves. I can say that my family has gone from a middle-class family to a lower-class family. The situation is much worse than before.\"\n\nMany believe the situation will only get worse as time goes on. Many of those who are young and unmarried discuss fleeing the country with friends. Those who are older simply shrug and watch as prices of everything from meat to medicines climb out of reach.\n\n\"We made a mistake when we shut down our nuclear program. As an Iranian, I say that was a mistake.

President Hassan Rouhani set a 60-day deadline for new terms to be reached by the nations still trying to keep the deal viable, and said if that didn't happen, Iran would resume enriching uranium to higher levels.\n\nRouhani's address to the nation came on the anniversary of President Trump's decision to unilaterally withdraw the U.S. from the landmark agreement. Rouhani said Iran wanted to negotiate new terms with the remaining partners in the deal, but acknowledged that the situation was dire.\n\nIran sent letters Wednesday on its decision to the leaders of Britain, China, the European Union, France and Germany via their ambassadors in Tehran. All were signatories to the nuclear deal and continue to support it. A letter also was given to Russia. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was to meet Wednesday in Moscow with his Russian counterpart.\n\n\"We felt that the nuclear deal needs a surgery and the painkiller pills of the last year have been ineffective,\" Rouhani said. \"This surgery is for saving the deal, not destroying it.\"\n\nStarting today, Iran does not keep its enriched uranium and produced heavy water limited.

Win-Win conditions will be accepted. \u2014 Hassan Rouhani (@HassanRouhani) May 8, 2019\n\nThe 2015 agreement saw sanctions on Iran lifted in exchange for the regime putting limits on its nuclear program. After the U.S. withdrew from the accord, the Trump administration restored crippling sanctions against Iran, exacerbating a severe economic crisis. The Trump administration has vowed to reduce Iran's vital oil exports to zero, by pressuring other countries to stop buying Iranian petroleum products.\n\n\"If the five countries join negotiations and help Iran to reach its benefits in the field of oil and banking, Iran will return to its commitments according to the nuclear deal,\" Rouhani said.\n\nHowever, Rouhani warned of a \"strong reaction\" if European leaders instead seek to impose more sanctions on Iran via the U.N. Security Council. He did not elaborate.\n\nZarif, on his visit to Moscow, issued his own warning via Twitter, saying that, \"after a year of patience, Iran stops measures that (the) US has made impossible to continue.\" He said the remaining countries had \"a narrowing window to reverse this.\"\n\nOn May 8 2018, US withdrew from #JCPOA, violated #UNSCR 2231 & pressured others\u2014incl #E3\u2014to do the same\n\nAfter a year of patience, Iran stops measures that US has made impossible to continue\n\nOur action is within the terms of JCPOA.\n\nEU/E3+2 has a narrowing window to reverse this. \u2014 Javad Zarif (@JZarif) May 8, 2019\n\nThe Reuters news service cited sources in the office of French President Emmanuel Macron as saying worldwide sanctions could be reimposed on Tehran if it reneges on terms of the nuclear deal.\n\nIran moving missiles by boat, official says\n\nThere was no immediate response from the U.S. to Iran's partial withdrawal announcement, but it came three days after the White House dispatched an aircraft carrier and a bomber wing to the Persian Gulf over what it described as a new threat from Iran.\n\nWhite House national security adviser John Bolton said Sunday evening that the decision to move the hardware, including four B-52 bombers, was in response to \"a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings.\" He didn't provide details, but said the U.S. wanted to send a \"clear and unmistakable\" message to Iran that \"unrelenting force\" would meet any attack on U.S. interests or those of its allies.\n\n\"The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces,\" he said.\n\nU.S. sends USS Lincoln to Mideast to warn Iran\n\nA U.S. official said on Tuesday that the Trump administration's decision was based in part on intelligence indications that Iran had moved short-range ballistic missiles by boat off its shores. The movement, first reported by CNN, was among a range of recent indications that Iran might be considering or preparing to attack U.S. forces in the region, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive intelligence.\n\nThe official said it was not clear whether the boats with missiles represented a new military capability that could be used against U.S. forces or were only being moved to shore locations.\n\nA Defense Department official told CBS News senior national defense correspondent David Martin earlier this week that the U.S. had detected \"a number of preparations for possible attack\" on U.S. forces at sea and on land.\n\n\"There is more than one avenue of attack or possible attack that we're tracking,\" the official said.\n\nThe nuke deal's terms\n\nWestern governments had long feared Iran's atomic program could allow it to build nuclear weapons. Iran has always maintained its program is for peaceful purposes.\n\nCurrently, the accord limits Iran to enriching uranium to 3.67 percent, which can fuel a commercial nuclear power plant. Weapons-grade uranium needs to be enriched to around 90 percent. However, once a country enriches uranium to around 20 percent, scientists say the time needed to reach 90 percent is halved. Iran has previously enriched to 20 percent.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal reached in 2015, Iran can keep a stockpile of no more than 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of low-enriched uranium. That's compared to the 22,046 pounds of higher-enriched uranium it once had.\n\nFallout of U.S. ending waivers on Iranian oil imports\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency -- the world's nuclear watchdog agency -- has repeatedly verified Iran's compliance with the nuclear deal since it was adopted, but President Trump, even before he was elected, disparaged the hard-won agreement as too generous to Iran.\n\nHis administration argued from the beginning that while Iran wasn't violating the stipulations of the deal, it was defying the \"spirit\" of the agreement, and the White House abandoned it for that reason -- much to the chagrin of the other parties involved.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nuclear-deal-iran-announces-partial-withdrawal-2015-pact/", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190910182529/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nuclear-deal-iran-announces-partial-withdrawal-2015-pact/", "origin": "WCEP", "id": "052bd0bd-477a-4a96-b35a-f0619baf8eed"}], "summary": "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani sends letters to the P5+1 leaders of the United Kingdom, China, Russia, Germany, France and the European Union announcing the country's partial withdrawal from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreement.

The election took place in the city of Aparecida, where the Brazilian episcopate is attending the 57th General Assembly of the NCBB.\n\nThe archbishop is now responsible for keeping unity among the Brazilian bishops for the next four years \u2013 in a time of great political polarization in the country.\n\nIn his inaugural speech, the 65-year-old Azevedo said that \u201conly the light of the faith can restore the strength of the collegiality in the Brazilian Church, through a very profound listening of the people of God.\u201d\n\nBishop Flavio Giovenale of Cruzeiro do Sul, in the Northern State of Roraima, said Azevedo has demonstrated competence in his time at Belo Horizonte, which is needed right now at the bishops\u2019 conference.\n\n\u201cIn his speech, Archbishop Azevedo said that one of his goals is to keep and increase the dialogue inside and outside the Church.

He was ordained a bishop in 1998 by Pope St. John Paul II and in 2004 became the Archbishop of Belo Horizonte. Over the years, he headed a number of commissions at the NCBB, and since 2009, he has been a member of the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. In 2014, Pope Francis appointed him as a member of the Congregation for the Eastern Churches.\n\nFrancisco Borba Ribeiro Neto, coordinator of the Center for Faith and Culture at the Pontifical Catholic University of S\u00e3o Paulo, told Crux Azevedo \u201chas good relations with all segments and has good bonds with bishops who are already involved in the NCBB\u2019s administration.\u201d\n\nBorba said the archbishop is seen as a moderate-progressive clergyman, who represents continuity in the NCBB\u2019s administration.\n\nSince its creation in the 1950s, the NCBB has been traditionally led by a socially progressive group \u2013 a natural consequence of the social problems such as poverty and inequality that the country has always faced.\n\nHowever, the Brazilian episcopate as a whole is mostly moderate in political terms, tending to avoid extremism and radicalization, said Borba. Now, with the increasing political polarization in Brazilian society, the Catholic community also started to feel a growing internal controversy.\n\nThe polarization gained steam in the second term of former President Dilma Rousseff, who ended up being impeached in 2016. It reached its climax during the 2018 presidential race \u2013 which resulted in the election of President Jair Bolsonaro. During the first 120 days of his administration, Bolsonaro, who is an unabashed admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump \u2013 has engaged in several disputes with segments of society identified by him as political opponents, including the Catholic Church.\n\nIn February, the Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo revealed that the military and the Brazilian intelligence agency were monitoring the preparatory activities of the Church for the Synod of Bishops for the Pan-Amazon Region, which will be held in Rome in October.\n\nDuring his campaign, Bolsonaro promised to do more to develop the Amazon region, 60 percent of which is in Brazil, drawing the ire of environmentalists and indigenous rights organizations.\n\nThe government, according to the story, was worried about the political nature of the activities. After the publication, a general involved in the case confirmed that the synod would deal with issues concerning national security, so the government was concerned about it \u2013 but he denied the military had been spying on members of the Brazilian clergy.\n\nAnalysts feared a possible fragmentation in the NCBB motivated by clashes between pro-Bolsonaro and leftist bishops; so the expectation was that a moderate voice would rise.\n\n\u201cNow, things will only get out of control if someone \u2013 either in the Catholic community or in the government \u2013 makes a big mistake, provoking an unwanted confrontation,\u201d Borba said.", "url": "https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the-americas/2019/05/08/new-president-of-bishops-conference-aims-for-dialogue-in-polarized-brazil/", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": "2019-05-08 05:59:53-04:00"}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9520900509604439, "vector": [0.16568111871602823, 0.1079548186153029, 0.0, 3.0], "id": 70120}], "id": "98bd41f2-fd65-46b3-9ad2-297bae3a2a8a", "title": "Trump to nominate Shanahan as defense secretary", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump will nominate Patrick Shanahan to be his second secretary of defense, the White House announced Thursday.\n\nThe former Boeing executive has been leading the Pentagon as acting secretary since Jan. 1, a highly unusual arrangement for arguably the most sensitive Cabinet position.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said \"Shanahan has proven over the last several months that he is beyond qualified to lead the Department of Defense, and he will continue to do an excellent job.\"\n\nMoments later, Shanahan spoke to reporters outside the Pentagon, saying he was very excited about the nomination and looking forward to a job he said requires him to \"spin a lot of plates.\"\n\n\"The biggest challenge is balancing it all.

The probe appeared to stall his nomination, but the IG wrapped up the investigation rapidly and cleared Shanahan of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe IG interviewed Shanahan as well as 33 witnesses under oath, including Mattis and members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n\"We did not substantiate any of the allegations. We determined that Mr. Shanahan fully complied with his ethics agreements and his ethical obligations regarding Boeing and its competitors,\" the report said.\n\nShanahan wields none of the star power of Trump's first defense secretary. And that may be just the thing for a commander in chief who seemed to resent Mattis for his reputation in Washington as a superior strategist and a moderating influence on an impulsive president.\n\nTwo months before Mattis resigned, citing policy differences, Trump publicly questioned whether he was \"sort of a Democrat.\" After the former Marine general quit, Trump spoke more harshly, calling Mattis a failure, and insisted he had fired him, even though Mattis had resigned first.\n\nShanahan, 56, has a lifetime of experience in the defense industry but little in government. In more than four months as the acting secretary, he has focused on implementing the national defense strategy that was developed during Mattis' tenure and emphasizes a shift from the resources and tactics required to fight small wars against extremist groups to what Shanahan calls \"great power\" competition with China and Russia.\n\nThe Shanahan nomination is not known to face any organized opposition in Congress, although some members have been lukewarm on him. Sen. James Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has questioned why Trump was taking so long to seek the Senate's consent but has indicated he would support Shanahan. Others have questioned whether Shanahan might be more willing to endorse plans or policies coming out of the White House.\n\nThis is only the third time in history that the Pentagon has been led by an acting chief. The last was William H. Taft, who served for two months in 1989 after President George H.W. Bush's first choice to be defense secretary, John Tower, became mired in controversy and ultimately failed to be confirmed by the Senate. Dick Cheney, the future vice president under President George W. Bush, then was nominated and confirmed.\n\nPresidents typically take pains to ensure the Pentagon is being run by a Senate-confirmed official, given the grave responsibilities that include sending young Americans into battle, ensuring the military is ready for extreme emergencies like nuclear war and managing overseas alliances that are central to U.S. security.\n\nShanahan, who grew up in Seattle, earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Washington and two advanced degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He joined Boeing in 1986, rose through its ranks and is credited with rescuing a troubled Dreamliner 787 program. He also led the company's missile defense and military helicopter programs.\n\nTrump has seemed attracted to Shanahan partially for his work on one of the president's pet projects \u2014 creating a Space Force. Trump also has publicly lauded Boeing, builder of many of the military's most prominent aircraft, including the Apache and Chinook helicopters, the C-17 cargo plane and the B-52 bomber, as well as the iconic presidential aircraft, Air Force One.\n\nAlthough a few members of the Senate have rhetorically roughed up Shanahan, he has not generated broad opposition during his months of auditioning for the nomination. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, butted heads with Shanahan over the administration's Syria policy, but that confrontation quickly faded after the White House partially reversed course by agreeing to keep a few hundred troops in Syria rather than withdrawing all 2,000.\n\nShanahan was the deputy secretary of defense during Mattis' two-year tenure. No one thought of him then as a potential No. 1 since he had never previously served in government and carried little political sway in Washington or in foreign capitals. Aides say that during his 17 months as deputy, Shanahan was deeply engaged in the full range of policy issues and briefed on military operations. He shares Mattis' conviction that the Pentagon needs to shift its focus from fighting insurgent wars to preparing for and deterring armed conflict with big powers like China.\n\n\"China, China, China,\" was his message to senior department officials the day he took over from Mattis, aides said.", "url": "https://www.dailysabah.com/americas/2019/05/09/trump-to-nominate-shanahan-as-defense-secretary", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": "2019-05-09 23:31:43+03:00"}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9433126192310289, "vector": [0.06975053988257096, 0.13602578161808435, 1.0, 3.0], "id": 70120}], "id": "befe4841-c5cf-4329-bb2d-01df597468eb", "title": "UPDATE 2-Brazil automakers fret about cheap imports from Mexico", "text": "SAO PAULO, May 7 (Reuters) - Automakers in Brazil warned on Tuesday of the threat from cheap imported cars from Mexico, as the end of a cap on bilateral trade in the sector presents a new challenge to the dominance of local manufacturing in Latin America\u2019s largest auto market.\n\nThe Brazil-based arms of global automakers such as General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, whose local plants have long benefited from high tariffs, said through national industry group Anfavea that they struggled to match Mexico\u2019s low production costs.\n\nThe Brazilian industry\u2019s warning echoes the concerns of U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. labor unions about the threat posed by increasingly efficient Mexican factories staffed with lower-paid workers.\n\nBrazil and Mexico agreed in March to open trade in light vehicles after years of capping trade volumes between the countries.

In other words, the Turkish president reminded NATO what it was supposed to do and responded to the incessant questioning of Turkey's position within NATO. Erdo\u011fan also urged member states to contribute to each other's defense: \"We will take steps required by our national interest whilst maintaining our strong position within NATO. The relationships that Turkey nurtures with various countries and regions complement, not contradict, each other.\"\n\nTurkey is determined to remain part of NATO and do what its national interest requires. Failure to answer Erdo\u011fan's call would only serve to deepen NATO's current crisis.\n\nThe alliance, which marked its 70th anniversary last month, faces many challenges. The single greatest challenge against NATO is U.S. President Donald Trump's disregard for the alliance and his view that NATO is obsolete. This is unprecedented in the organization's entire history.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassadors to NATO, Douglas Lute and Nicholas Burns, believe that NATO also faces the following challenges: Restoring European defense strength, upholding NATO's democratic values, streamlining NATO's decision-making, containing Russia, ending the Afghan war, refocusing NATO partnerships, maintaining an open door for future members, winning the technology battle in the digital age and competing with China.\n\nIf NATO fails to solve the problems between Turkey and the United States on account of the latter's dominance over the organization, it will further deepen its own crisis.", "url": "https://www.dailysabah.com/columns/duran-burhanettin/2019/05/09/nato-in-crisis", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": "2019-05-08 23:49:53+03:00"}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.9433126192310289, "vector": [0.06975053988257096, 0.13602578161808435, 1.0, 3.0], "id": 70120}], "id": "d9690a9e-923b-4906-b723-da0117805d74", "title": "UPDATE 2-Brazil automakers fret about cheap imports from Mexico", "text": "SAO PAULO, May 7 (Reuters) - Automakers in Brazil warned on Tuesday of the threat from cheap imported cars from Mexico, as the end of a cap on bilateral trade in the sector presents a new challenge to the dominance of local manufacturing in Latin America\u2019s largest auto market.\n\nThe Brazil-based arms of global automakers such as General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, whose local plants have long benefited from high tariffs, said through national industry group Anfavea that they struggled to match Mexico\u2019s low production costs.\n\nThe Brazilian industry\u2019s warning echoes the concerns of U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. labor unions about the threat posed by increasingly efficient Mexican factories staffed with lower-paid workers.\n\nBrazil and Mexico agreed in March to open trade in light vehicles after years of capping trade volumes between the countries. Mexico has been seeking to diversify trading partners since Trump warned of the possible end to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that has defined Mexico\u2019s economy.\n\nAnfavea officials said they had presented the Brazilian government with a study comparing production costs and tax burdens facing auto plants in Mexico and Brazil to underscore the challenge.\n\n\u201cWe have a very modern industry in Brazil,\u201d said Luiz Carlos Moraes, a Mercedes-Benz executive who assumed the presidency of Anfavea in recent weeks. \u201cWe can tend to our market. That is what we defend.\u201d\n\nEduardo Solis, the president of the Mexican Auto Industry Association, known as AMIA, said his members were not concerned about the new trade rules with Brazil, and that the two groups had already met to discuss the future.\n\nBrazil is one of the world\u2019s most closed major economies and its size has historically helped lured some of the world\u2019s largest automakers to set up local production there, serving what had been one of the world\u2019s top five car markets before a recent slump.\n\n\u201cWe cannot lose our current production volume, or our ability to generate jobs, or our ability to affect the country\u2019s GDP,\u201d Moraes said, citing statistics that were compiled by PwC consultants at Anfavea\u2019s request.\n\nMoraes said the study had concluded that making a car in Mexico was 18 percent cheaper than in Brazil and that importing a Mexican car to Brazil was still cheaper than a locally made one.\n\nHe made the comments at a news conference presenting monthly statistics, which showed automobile production in Brazil rose 11.1 percent in April from March, while sales rose 10.9 percent.\n\nAutomakers in Brazil produced around 267,500 new cars and trucks last month, while sales totaled about 231,900 vehicles. Compared with a year ago, auto output rose 0.5 percent and sales grew by 6.7 percent.

In many areas, the vote in favor of the ICJ was unexpected. Overall, 65% of the 148,500 of electorates that re-registered came to vote. The Belize District registered the highest turn out with 69%, while in the Toledo District, only 59% came out to cast their vote.\n\nNow that Belizeans have opted to take the territorial dispute to the ICJ, the government must start preparing to face Guatemala at this international court. In the next six months, both countries will have the time to start planning their presentations, which will take place inside the Peace Palace, at The Hague, Netherlands, where the ICJ is headquartered. Guatemala will first present its evidence on her rights over Belize. Belize will then have six months to dispute the Guatemalan claim and convince the judges that its neighbor to the west has absolutely no title or rights over the Jewel.\n\nFor a complete report on the referendum process, look for our detailed story in the print issue of The San Pedro Sun out this Friday, May 10th.\n\nFollow The San Pedro Sun News on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook.

May 7, 2019\u2013 In less than 24 hours, Belizeans from all walks of life from all corners of the country will converge on the 344 polling stations that are scattered across the country to vote in a historic referendum on whether or not the International Court of Justice (ICJ) will decide on a judicial end to the Guatemalan claim that has been bedeviling the country and was largely responsible for delaying its political independence, which was finally achieved on September 21, 1981.\n\nIn December 2008, a strange creature crept into Belize\u2019s political vocabulary, when Belize Foreign Minister Wilfred Elrington signed an agreement with the Republic of Guatemala known as the Special Agreement (compromis).\n\nUnder the protocol of the Special Agreement both Belize and Guatemala pledge to hold referenda simultaneously, but the agreement was later amended so that Guatemala could proceed ahead of Belize with its referendum, which it held on April 15, 2018, when Guatemalans went to the polls in their ICJ referendum.\n\nThe question that was asked of Guatemalan voters is the same question that will be asked of Belizean voters \u201cDo you agree that any legal claim of Guatemala against Belize relating to land and insular territories and to any maritime areas pertaining to these territories should be submitted to the International Court of Justice for final settlement and that it determines finally the boundaries of the respective territories and areas of the Parties?\u201d\n\nThe government of Prime Minister Dean Barrow continues to insist, based on a string of legal opinions from international law experts that Belize has an iron-clad case and cannot lose if the claim is taken to the ICJ. For its part, the government embarked on a massive \u201cyes to the ICJ\u201d education campaign. The proponents of the \u201cno to the ICJ\u201d point to the one-sided nature of the government\u2019s campaign.\n\nAs the government continued its push for going to the ICJ, the Opposition, People\u2019s United Party (PUP) embarked on what it called a country wide consultation in all 31 constituencies. Following those consultations, the PUP issued \u201cThe People\u2019s Declaration\u201d which emphasized that the PUP adopted a no to the ICJ.\n\nThe PUP would go further, as the referendum date of April 10 got closer and following the publication of a joint legal opinion by three attorneys, Anthony Sylvestre, Dickie Bradley and Kareem Musa, 5 PUP parliamentarians and one standard bearer signed to become claimants in a constitutional challenge to the Special Agreement.\n\nOn April 3, one week before the scheduled April 10 referendum day, the PUP claimants applied for and received an interim injunction from Belize Chief Justice, Hon. Kenneth Benjamin, which stopped the referendum in its tracks.\n\nThe court found that unbeknownst to anyone, the prime minister had submitted for the Governor General, a writ of referendum. The writ of referendum, however, was faulty, and the Chief Justice pounced on it and granted the interim injunction.\n\nThis derailed the government\u2019s plan to hold the referendum, but not for long. The Prime Minister almost immediately called a meeting of the House of Representatives, at which meeting his government introduced and passed the Belize Territorial Dispute Referendum Bill 2019. A few days later went to the Senate, where it was passed by majority vote. The ink wasn\u2019t dry before the government announced the new date for the referendum, tomorrow, May 8th.", "url": "https://amandala.com.bz/news/referendum-postponed-april-10-set-tomorrow-8/", "origin": "CommonCrawl", "time": "2019-05-08 00:00:00+00:00"}, {"events": [{"probability": 0.999749526966436, "vector": [0.29428574556000475, 0.43336578910931695, 1.0, 2.0], "id": 70121}], "id": "244eb8ec-8a6d-4fca-8f22-622b04f295cf", "title": "Belizeans vote to ask U.N. court to settle Guatemala border dispute", "text": "BELIZE CITY, (Reuters) \u2013 Belizeans have voted to ask the United Nations world court to decide Guatemala\u2019s claim that it is the rightful owner of half of Belize\u2019s territory, setting the scene for a resolution to a dispute that has rumbled on for centuries.\n\nIn a referendum held yesterday, 55.4 percent of voters opted to send the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, according to results published by Belize\u2019s elections and boundaries department today.\n\nThe remaining 44.6 percent of voters in the former British colony in Central America opposed the motion to ask the court.\n\nGuatemalans in April 2018 voted by an overwhelming majority to have the ICJ rule on the dispute, which stretches back to the dawn of the colonial era in the Americas.\n\nIn a statement, Guatemala\u2019s government applauded the result and said it would immediately contact the foreign ministry of Belize to agree the next steps in the process.\n\n\u201cThe final resolution of the dispute will broaden and deepen the good relations that exist between Guatemala and Belize,\u201d the Guatemalan foreign ministry said.\n\nMarta Larra, a spokeswoman for the ministry, estimated it could be around four years before a final court decision.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for Guatemala is defining the border,\u201d said Larra.\n\nOfficials from the U.S. State Department, the European Union and the Organization of American States (OAS) also welcomed the outcome of the referendum.\n\nGuatemala recognized the independence of Belize at the beginning of the 1990s.
